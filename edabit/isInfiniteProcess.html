/*
Given integers a and b, determine whether the following pseudocode results in an infinite loop

while a is not equal to b do
  increase a by 1
  decrease b by 1
Assume that the program is executed on a virtual machine which can store arbitrary long numbers and execute forever.

Example

For a = 2 and b = 6, the output should be
isInfiniteProcess(a, b) = false;
For a = 2 and b = 3, the output should be
isInfiniteProcess(a, b) = true.
*/
    function isInfiniteProcess(a, b) {
        return a > b || a % 2 !== b % 2
      }
/* Exactly the same as top solution */
