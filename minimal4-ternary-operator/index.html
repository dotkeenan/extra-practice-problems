    /* In the Code tab you will find code that is missing a single character in
    order to pass the tests. However, your goal is to submit a function as
    minimalist as possible. Use the tips in the tips section below.

    Write a function that returns the strings:

    "both" if both given booleans a and b are true.
    "first" if only a is true.
    "second" if only b is true .
    "neither" if both a and b are false. */

    function areTrue(a, b)  {
      return a == true && b == true ? 'both'
      : a == true ? 'first'
      : b == true ? 'second'
      : 'neither'
    }
