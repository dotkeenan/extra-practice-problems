      /*
      Learn Lodash: _.dropRight, Drop the Last Elements of an Array
      According to the lodash documentation, _.dropRight Creates a slice of an array with n elements dropped from the end.

      This challenge requires you to write your own version of this function without using lodash so that you can better understand it works.

      Examples
      dropRight([1, 2, 3]) ➞ [1, 2]

      dropRight([1, 2, 3], 2) ➞ [1]

      dropRight([1, 2, 3], 5) ➞ []

      dropRight([1, 2, 3], 0) ➞ [1, 2, 3]
      Notes
      Do not attempt to import lodash; you are simply writing your own version.
      This entire series of challenges can be found here.
