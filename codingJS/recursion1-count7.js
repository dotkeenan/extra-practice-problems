/* description
Given a non-negative int n, return the count of the occurrences of 7 as a digit, so for example 717 yields 2. (no loops). Note that mod (%) by 10 yields the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while flooring division (Math.floor(n/10)) by 10 removes the rightmost digit [Math.floor(126 / 10) is 12].

Examples

count7(717) → 2
count7(7) → 1
count7(123) → 0
