/*
Given some integer, find the maximal number you can obtain by deleting exactly one digit of the given number.

Example

For n = 152, the output should be
deleteDigit(n) = 52;
For n = 1001, the output should be
deleteDigit(n) = 101.
*/
    function deleteDigit(n) {
        const res = [];
        const digits = n.toString().split('');
        for (let i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {
          let tempDigits = [...digits];
          tempDigits.splice(i, 1);
          res.push(Number(tempDigits.join('')));
        }
        return Math.max(...res)
      }
/* Pseudocode
create an empty an array and assign it to a storage named 'res'
turn the number to a string and split it into individual digits, store it in a storage named 'digits'

iterate over digits
create a storange named tempDigits which gets assigned a shallow copy of 'digits' so that we can reset the spliced digits each iteration

splice out the current iteration, then join the rest of the array back into a string number
convert to a number as well, during the joining process.

push the resulting number into res

return the highest value in res.
*/

/* top solution:
turn number to string
Then in a terribly unreadable 1 liner return:
It uses the index to progressively contatenate slices, to populate
an array that is created with the Array() function/method.

the slicing:
So lets say s = '123'
the first slice gets nothing, second slice gets '23'
i becomes 1.
first slice gets '1', second slice gets '3'
i becomes 2
first slice gets '12' second slice gets nothing.
They all get converted to a number.

The array constructor:
It creates an array with 'x' amt of elements, where 'x' is s.length
Using logic, if 's'.length is 3, then there are 3 instances in which a digit
gets removed from 's'.

keys() is an Array/Object method that returns an ITERATOR that contains keys for each
index in the array.
So like [...Array(4).keys()] returns [0,1,2,3]
So it maps over each index and uses that index value to do the slicing.

function deleteDigit(n) {
    s = n.toString()
    return Math.max(...[...Array(s.length).keys()]
    .map(i=>Number(s.slice(0,i)+s.slice(i+1))))}
