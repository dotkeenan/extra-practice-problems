/* description
Consider a sequence of numbers a0, a1, ..., an, in which an element is equal to the sum of squared digits of the previous element. The sequence ends once an element that has already been in the sequence appears again.

Given the first element a0, find the length of the sequence.

Example

For a0 = 16, the output should be
squareDigitsSequence(a0) = 9.

Here's how elements of the sequence are constructed:

a0 = 16
a1 = 12 + 62 = 37
a2 = 32 + 72 = 58
a3 = 52 + 82 = 89
a4 = 82 + 92 = 145
a5 = 12 + 42 + 52 = 42
a6 = 42 + 22 = 20
a7 = 22 + 02 = 4
a8 = 42 = 16, which has already occurred before (a0)
Thus, there are 9 elements in the sequence.

For a0 = 103, the output should be
squareDigitsSequence(a0) = 4.

The sequence goes as follows: 103 -> 10 -> 1 -> 1, 4 elements altogether.
*/
    function squareDigitsSequence(a0) {
        let currSum = a0.toString();
        const sums = [];

        while (!sums.includes(currSum)) {
          sums.push(currSum)
          let square = currSum.split('').map(x => {
            return x = Math.pow(Number(x), 2)
          }).reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur).toString()
          currSum = square;
        }
        return sums.length + 1;
      }
/* pseudocode
Can't think of a way to do this without lots of
converting between string and number.
Tried thinking of a way to cut up the numbers using powers of 10, but couldn't come up with something.

create a storage named sums and initialize it as an empty array.

create a storage named currSum and initialize it as a0 converted to a string.

create a loop that runs as long as 'sums' does not contain currSum.
within the loop:
push currSum into sums.

create a storage named square and set it equal to the following:
split curSum into an array of individual string digits

map over the array and square each digit as a NUMBER

reduce the array down to a single number by adding the digits together, and then converting it into a string.

assign 'square' to 'currSum'

return sums.length + 1
(+1 is to account for the duplicate value that ends the sequence, but never gets added to the array).
