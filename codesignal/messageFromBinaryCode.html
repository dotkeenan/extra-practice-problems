You are taking part in an Escape Room challenge designed specifically for programmers. In your efforts to find a clue, you've found a binary code written on the wall behind a vase, and realized that it must be an encrypted message. After some thought, your first guess is that each consecutive 8 bits of the code stand for the character with the corresponding extended ASCII code.

Assuming that your hunch is correct, decode the message.

Example

For code = "010010000110010101101100011011000110111100100001", the output should be
messageFromBinaryCode(code) = "Hello!".

The first 8 characters of the code are 01001000, which is 72 in the binary numeral system. 72 stands for H in the ASCII-table, so the first letter is H.
Other letters can be obtained in the same manner.

    function messageFromBinaryCode(code) {
        let binString = '';
        const splitCodes = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < code.length; i += 8) {
          splitCodes.push(code.substr(i, 8))
        }
        splitCodes.map(x => {
          binString += String.fromCharCode(parseInt(x, 2))
        })
        return binString;
      }
/* pseudocode
      create a storage for the end result string, named binString
      create a storage for the individual codes when splitting the 'code' into lengths of 8, named splitCodes.  initialize as an empty array.

      create a loop that will push portions of 'code' into 'splitCodes'
      the loop is initialized at i = 0, has a condition that runs as long as i is less than the length of the 'code',
      and has a final step of adding 8 to i.

      In the loop, push the portion of 'code' starting at 'i', and going the length of 8 characters.

      map over the splitCodes array in order to convert each string of code into a letter.
      use parseInt with a radix of 2, to convert it to a character code
      Then convert it to an alphanumeric character with String.fromCharCode
      Add and assign the result of that expression to binString
