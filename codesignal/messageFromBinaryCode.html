/* pseudocode
      create a storage for the end result string, named binString
      create a storage for the individual codes when splitting the 'code' into lengths of 8, named splitCodes.  initialize as an empty array.

      create a loop that will push portions of 'code' into 'splitCodes'
      the loop is initialized at i = 0, has a condition that runs as long as i is less than the length of the 'code',
      and has a final step of adding 8 to i.

      In the loop, push the portion of 'code' starting at 'i', and going the length of 8 characters.

      map over the splitCodes array in order to convert each string of code into a letter.
      use parseInt with a radix of 2, to convert it to a character code
      Then convert it to an alphanumeric character with String.fromCharCode
      Add and assign the result of that expression to binString
