/* description
Some phone usage rate may be described as follows:

first minute of a call costs min1 cents,
each minute from the 2nd up to 10th (inclusive) costs min2_10 cents
each minute after 10th costs min11 cents.
You have s cents on your account before the call. What is the duration of the longest call (in minutes rounded down to the nearest integer) you can have?

Example

For min1 = 3, min2_10 = 1, min11 = 2, and s = 20, the output should be
phoneCall(min1, min2_10, min11, s) = 14.

Here's why:

the first minute costs 3 cents, which leaves you with 20 - 3 = 17 cents;
the total cost of minutes 2 through 10 is 1 * 9 = 9, so you can talk 9 more minutes and still have 17 - 9 = 8 cents;
each next minute costs 2 cents, which means that you can talk 8 / 2 = 4 more minutes.
Thus, the longest call you can make is 1 + 9 + 4 = 14 minutes long.

    function phoneCall(min1, min2_10, min11, s) {
        if (s < min1) return 0;
        if (s === min1) return 1;
        let minutes = 1;
        let wallet = s - min1;
        let b, c;

        if (wallet / min2_10 > 9) {
          b = 9;
          wallet -= 9 * min2_10;
        } else {
          b = wallet / min2_10;
          wallet -= Math.floor(wallet / min2_10) * min2_10;
          return Math.floor(minutes + b);
        }

        if (wallet >= min11) {
          c = wallet / min11;
          wallet -= Math.floor(wallet / min11) * min11;
        }

        return Math.floor(minutes + b + c)
      }
