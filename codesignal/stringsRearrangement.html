    /*
    Given an array of equal-length strings, you'd like to know if it's possible
    to rearrange the order of the elements in such a way that each consecutive
    pair of strings differ by exactly one character. Return true if it's
    possible, and false if not.

Note: You're only rearranging the order of the strings, not the order of the
letters within the strings!

Example

For inputArray = ["aba", "bbb", "bab"], the output should be
stringsRearrangement(inputArray) = false.

There are 6 possible arrangements for these strings:

["aba", "bbb", "bab"]
["aba", "bab", "bbb"]
["bbb", "aba", "bab"]
["bbb", "bab", "aba"]
["bab", "bbb", "aba"]
["bab", "aba", "bbb"]
None of these satisfy the condition of consecutive strings differing by 1
character, so the answer is false.

For inputArray = ["ab", "bb", "aa"], the output should be
stringsRearrangement(inputArray) = true.

It's possible to arrange these strings in a way that each consecutive pair of
strings differ by 1 character (eg: "aa", "ab", "bb" or "bb", "ab", "aa"),
so return true.

/*
Very confusing.

* getPermutations() is in charge of finding every possible combination of order of
inputArray's elements.  so if inputArray = ['aa', 'ab'], the perms would be
[['aa', 'ab'], ['ab','aa']]
* fullLength is a variable used for knowing when the max length for a sequence is.
* sequence is an array that stores the current combination of array elements,
so like ["ab", "aa"]
* permutations is an array that holds an entire sequence.  A sequence is pushed
to permutations, once it has reached fullLength.
* permute(a) is a function that finds all the difference combinations of order
for one sequence.
* if inputArray is [1,2,3], it will start with [1], then with process of elimination,
become [1,2,3] or [1,3,2] and will push both of those to permutations.

** walkthrough of permute(a) where a = [1,2,3]
*i = 0, str = a[i], so
str = 1, and gets pushed to sequence, so sequence === [1]
*sequence.length is only '1' and not '3', so it goes to the 'else'
*'remaining' consists of all other elements of 'a' that arent a[i], uses spread
operator to basically concat all array elems to the left and to the right of a[0]
since there's nothing to the left of a[0], it takes everything to the right,
so remaining === [2,3]
* permute(remainder) gets recursively run again with [2,3]
* note that the original i is STILL 0.  The new recursive i is also 0 ??
* It goes through again recursively, where a[0] aka a[i] is now 2.
* It gets pushed and sequence is now [1,2].  Still < fullLength so it goes to the 'else'
* remaining === [3]
* Permute([3]) runs one more time (2nd recursive call) and sequence becomes [1,2,3]
* Now sequence.length === fullLength so it pushes [1,2,3] into 'permutations'
* So now after the push, it skips down to the sequence.pop() (we are still inside
 the recursively run function)
* sequence.pop() makes sequence === [1,2]
* a, or remainder now only has [3] in it, so a.length is 1.  i++ increments to 1.
* So the for loop condition doesn't get met since 1 !< 1
* So finally, we exit the recursively run permute().  But we still have to finish
the originally run permute().
* So it continues right at sequence.pop(), so in all, sequence.pop() ran twice!
* So sequence = [1], and a = [2,3] (hard to keep track of, but this is from the
original, non-recursive permute())
* So now i++ increments the original i to 1.
* and str, or a[1] === 3, and that get's pushed to sequence.
* So now sequence = [1,3]
*  Another loop through, and sequence becomes [1,3,2]
* So that's how it get's all the combinations that start with 1.
* The nature of the recursive functions makes this incredibly confusing.
* The face that during the first call of permute, you enter a sort of bubble where
permute gets called again and again until a condition is met, then you exit the bubble,
and resume the initial permute call as if nothing has ever happened.

To see this in action, throw it in dev tools and add breakpoints.
