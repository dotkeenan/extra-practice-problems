/*
A string is said to be beautiful if each letter in the string appears at most as many times as the previous letter in the alphabet within the string; ie: b occurs no more times than a; c occurs no more times than b; etc. Note that letter a has no previous letter.

Given a string, check whether it is beautiful.

Example

For inputString = "bbbaacdafe", the output should be isBeautifulString(inputString) = true.

This string contains 3 as, 3 bs, 1 c, 1 d, 1 e, and 1 f (and 0 of every other letter), so since there aren't any letters that appear more frequently than the previous letter, this string qualifies as beautiful.

For inputString = "aabbb", the output should be isBeautifulString(inputString) = false.

Since there are more bs than as, this string is not beautiful.

For inputString = "bbc", the output should be isBeautifulString(inputString) = false.

Although there are more bs than cs, this string is not beautiful because there are no as, so therefore there are more bs than as.

/*
brainstorm:
split the string and sort it.
make a storage named prev to store the amt of times a letter appears.
make a storage named curr to store the amt of times the current iterated letter has appeared.
(or potentially just check if array[i] === array[i-1] in the loop)

loop over the array
make a condition, if array[i] === array[i-1], then increment curr by 1.\

if not, assign curr to prev.
check if curr > prev, if it is, return false.
assign 1 to curr.

other way:
make a counter variable, initialized as 0;
make an array to store numbers representing the amt of times a character appears.
iterate over array, start at index 1
if current iteration is equal to previous iteration, increment a counter.
if not, push counter into array and reset counter to 1.


ISSUE: The previous letters must ALL EXIST IN THE STRING.  So dumb.
example: bbc is false because there are zero a's and two b's, and the previous
letter in the alphabet must have more appearances
*/

/* top solution:
Interesting approach I wouldn't have thought of.
Requires deep understanding of split() and flat out, good logic.

store the alphabet as a string in the variable 's'
iterate over the entire alphabet
check if the length of inputString, split at each alphabetic letter iteration,
is greater than the same thing, but of the previous alphabet letter.
the .length-1 is for logical clarity and to offset the actual count of letters.

So let's say inputString == 'bbbaacdafe'
the loop starts at '1', or 'b' in the alphabet.
it splits inputString at 'b' and returns ['', '', '', 'aacdafe']

If a separator appears at the beginning or end of the string, it still
has the effect of splitting.  The result is an empty string ('') which
appears at the first or last position of the returned array.

My take on it is, is that if the seperator has consecutive appearances
and either starts or ends the string, then each appearance gets replaced
with an empty string.

The weird case is when multiple consecutive seperators are sandwiched.
i.e. 'baaab'.split('a') returns ['b', '', '', 'b']
So what I think is happening is exactly what I mentioned above but a little extra step
So it splits the string first into ['b', 'aab']

It see's there are more a's, and in 'aab', the consecutive seperators
are at the beginning of the string, so it converts the two a's into empty strings,
just like the documentation says it should.
so then you get ['b', '', '', 'b'].
the .length - 1 is to offset the amount of a's there actually are, since like:
if you 'bab'.split('a').length, it would return 2, because there are two remaining
elements after the split.  But since we want to represent the amt of a's and not
the amount of split elements, we do length-1.

So that's what is happening in the original:
 'bbbaacdafe'.split('a') returns [ 'bbb', '', 'cd', 'fe' ]
 under the hood, it splits it to ['bbb', 'acd', 'fe']
 Since the seperator is at the beginning of a string/iterable,
 it still splits it, and returns an empty string in its place.

 So that is the meat an bones of it all. You really have to have a strong
 understanding of how split() works under the hood and with multiple consecutive
 seperators.

function isBeautifulString(inputString) {
    s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    for (i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (inputString.split(s[i]).length-1 > inputString.split(s[i-1]).length-1) {
            return false}}
    return true}
