/*
You have deposited a specific amount of money into your bank account. Each year your balance increases at the same growth rate. With the assumption that you don't make any additional deposits, find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific threshold.

Example

For deposit = 100, rate = 20, and threshold = 170, the output should be
depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) = 3.

Each year the amount of money in your account increases by 20%. So throughout the years, your balance would be:

year 0: 100;
year 1: 120;
year 2: 144;
year 3: 172.8.
Thus, it will take 3 years for your balance to pass the threshold, so the answer is 3.

    function depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) {
        let year = 0;
        let account = deposit;
        while (account < threshold) {
          account += (account * (rate / 100))
          year++;
        }
        return year;
      }

top solution:
I dont fully understand this solution.
Math.log() functions as ln(x) in mathematics.
The way that this solution uses it, is like finding the base log
when given two numbers (x and y).
Similar to a the example pattern on MDN, it seems to try and find x^z, where
z === the exponent needed to turn x into 'y'.
so if x = 5, and y = 625, z = 4, because 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 625.
Im hazy on the (t/d) and (r/100 + 1) portions of this.
**the natural log of x is the power that is needed to raise 'e' to = x.
***If you need a logarithm to other bases, use Math.log(x) / Math.log(otherBase)
So in the solution below, it seems like what's happening is using the base of
(r/100+1).

function depositProfit(d, r, t) {
    return Math.ceil(Math.log(t/d)/Math.log(r/100+1));
}
