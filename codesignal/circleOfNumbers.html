/*
Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way that the distance between any two neighboring numbers is equal (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighboring, too).

Given n and firstNumber, find the number which is written in the radially opposite position to firstNumber.

Example

For n = 10 and firstNumber = 2, the output should be
circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) = 7.

basically looks like a clock that starts at 0 and ends at 'n'

/*
my own one-liner:
// I realize that making an array is totally unnecessary
return [...Array(n).keys()][(firstNumber + n/2) % n]

top solution:
same as my one-liner, minus the need for making an array.
function circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) {
  return (n/2+firstNumber)%n
}
