/* pseudocode
create a storage named 'count' and initialize it as 0.  This keeps track of how many ways that consecutive integers add up to 'n'.
create a loop that initializes 'i' as 1 and goes until n (probably should stop sooner but unsure of a definite hard cap
probably about n/2 rounded upwards.)

create a storage named sum and initialize it to 0.

on each iteration, create a nested loop that initializes j as i + 1 and runs as long as 'sum' is less than or equal to 'n'
within the loop, add j to sum and re-assign the result of it to sum.
if res equals n, increment 'count'.
if res > than 'n', stop the loop and return to the outter loop.

return count
