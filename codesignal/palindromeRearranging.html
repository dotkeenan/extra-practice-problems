explanation of my code:
my logic behind it was finding out the constraints of what a palindrome can be composed of
i found that to be a palindrome there could only be one letter group that has an odd amount of characters.
(like if there are 3 b's, there can be no other letter with an odd amount of appearances.)

1.  I created a 'letters' to house a list of all the unique letters that appear in the string
2.  Create 'counter' to count how many times there was a letter that had an odd amt of appearances.
3.  Used forEach() in order to iterate over inputString and create the list of unique characters that would appear in 'letters'
4.  Used forEach() to iterate over the unique letters.
  -Then used filter() and .length to find how many times each letter appears in inputString.
  -I use modulous on the returned length to check if the letter has an odd amount of appearances.
      -Used logical AND operator to increment oddArrAmt if the length was odd.
5.  Created conditional for if there is only 1 letter in inputString, just return true;
      -Conditional returns true if oddArrAmt is <= to 1 since thats the constrain a palindrome has
      -Else returned false.


Given a string, find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

Example

For inputString = "aabb", the output should be
palindromeRearranging(inputString) = true.

We can rearrange "aabb" to make "abba", which is a palindrome.

Top Solution:
function palindromeRearranging(inputString) {
    return inputString.split('').sort().join('').replace(/(\w)\1/g,'').length < 2;
}

Split the string into individual letters, sort them by alphabetical order, join
them back into a string.
Use replace() to replace all instances of a match followed by an identical letter, with ''
      -basicaly it deletes it.
The regex is the meat of it.
First is a capture group of: \w matches any letter a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _
then \1 matches the same text as most recently matched by the first capture group.
example string: aabddc
so basically (\w) will match the first 'a' then \1 matches the next 'a'
it will NOT match b since \1 doesn't find another b.
It matches 'dd'
It doesn't match 'c'.

The theory behind it, is the same as my solution:
There can only be one odd numbered amount of characters.
This accomplishes it in a bit of a different way.  Since it sorts the array, he/she
basically pairs up the repeating characters and then deletes them from the string
by using replace(pair, '').  So even if there are 3 b's, it will delete 2 of the b's
and all that will be left is a single b in the entire string.  So at the end, it
checks if the length of the string is less than 2, becaus there should only be
a single letter left, if it can be a palindrome.  If there were 2 odd numbered
unique character amounts, the length of the string would be 2 or more, and fail.
