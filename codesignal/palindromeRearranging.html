/*
explanation of my code:
my logic behind it was finding out the constraints of what a palindrome can be composed of
i found that to be a palindrome there could only be one letter group that has an odd amount of characters.
(like if there are 3 b's, there can be no other letter with an odd amount of appearances.)

1.  I created a 'letters' to house a list of all the unique letters that appear in the string
2.  Create 'counter' to count how many times there was a letter that had an odd amt of appearances.
3.  Used forEach() in order to iterate over inputString and create the list of unique characters that would appear in 'letters'
4.  Used forEach() to iterate over the unique letters.
  -Then used filter() and .length to find how many times each letter appears in inputString.
  -I use modulous on the returned length to check if the letter has an odd amount of appearances.
      -Used logical AND operator to increment oddArrAmt if the length was odd.
5.  Created conditional for if there is only 1 letter in inputString, just return true;
      -Conditional returns true if oddArrAmt is <= to 1 since thats the constrain a palindrome has
      -Else returned false.


Given a string, find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

Example

For inputString = "aabb", the output should be
palindromeRearranging(inputString) = true.

We can rearrange "aabb" to make "abba", which is a palindrome.
