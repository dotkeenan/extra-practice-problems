/*  description
CodeMaster has just returned from shopping. He scanned the check of the items he bought and gave the resulting string to Ratiorg to figure out the total number of purchased items. Since Ratiorg is a bot he is definitely going to automate it, so he needs a program that sums up all the numbers which appear in the given input.

Help Ratiorg by writing a function that returns the sum of numbers that appear in the given inputString.

Example

For inputString = "2 apples, 12 oranges", the output should be
sumUpNumbers(inputString) = 14.
*/
    function sumUpNumbers(inputString) {
        let res = 0;
        const numbers = inputString.match(/(\d+)/g)
        if (!numbers) return res;
        numbers.forEach(x => res += Number(x))
        return res;
      }
/* pseudo code
create a regex that matches digits only
it should be returned in an array

create a catch for when there are no numbers in the string, and return res (which defaults to 0) if this is the case.

make sure their datatype is 'number'

can't use reduce() since some arrays only have 1 element in it.

Instead, create a storage to keep the running total named 'res'
use a for loop and iterates over the 'numbers' array and use addition assignment to add current iteration (convert to number) value to
the running total storage, named 'res'
