/*  description
CodeMaster has just returned from shopping. He scanned the check of the items he bought and gave the resulting string to Ratiorg to figure out the total number of purchased items. Since Ratiorg is a bot he is definitely going to automate it, so he needs a program that sums up all the numbers which appear in the given input.

Help Ratiorg by writing a function that returns the sum of numbers that appear in the given inputString.

Example

For inputString = "2 apples, 12 oranges", the output should be
sumUpNumbers(inputString) = 14.
*/
    function sumUpNumbers(inputString) {
        let res = 0;
        const numbers = inputString.match(/(\d+)/g) // the capture group is unnecessary
        if (!numbers) return res;
        numbers.forEach(x => res += Number(x))
        return res;
      }
/* pseudo code
create a regex that matches digits only
it should be returned in an array

create a catch for when there are no numbers in the string, and return res (which defaults to 0) if this is the case.

make sure their datatype is 'number'

can't use reduce() since some arrays only have 1 element in it.
-After seeing top solution, I can actually use reduce if I add an 'or' clause
and return an empty array if the match() comes up empty (falsey).

Instead, create a storage to keep the running total named 'res'
use a for loop and iterates over the 'numbers' array and use addition assignment to add current iteration (convert to number) value to
the running total storage, named 'res'
*/

/* top solution:
Same use of match() and same regex string as my solution.

Gets around the reduce() typeError if the match() is empty and doesn't
return an array at all.

If the inputString.match() finds numbers, then it will return an array with
the found matches, if not, it will return an empty array.
-this way, reduce() won't run into an error if there are no matches.

Next they use a reduce function and incorporates the unary plus operator
in order to convert 'b' into a number data type
'a' or previousValue is initialized as the number 0.
0 is added to the number version of 'b' due to +b.

Also initializing a as 0 fixes the issue in which there is only 1 number
in the array.

Previously I just had 'a' as the first array element, and 'b' as the 2nd,
so currentValue (b) was undefined when there was only 1 array element.

function sumUpNumbers(inputString) {
  return (inputString.match(/\d+/g)||[]).reduce((a,b)=>a+ +b,0)
}
