/* description
Determine if the given number is a power of some non-negative integer.

Example

For n = 125, the output should be
isPower(n) = true;
For n = 72, the output should be
isPower(n) = false.
*/
    function isPower(n) {
        if (n === 1) return true;
        let i = 2
        while (i <= 20) {
          let x = n;
          while (x % i === 0) {
            x = x / i;
            if (x === i) {
              return true;
            };
          }
          i++
        }
        return false;
      }

/* pseudocode
create a quick catch for if n === 1, return true;

initialize a storage named 'i', as 2.

create a loop that runs as long as i is less than or equal to 20
(n is a number between 0 and 401, so the largest possible value of i is 20,
since 20 * 20 = 400)
create a storage named 'x' and set it equal to 'n'

create nested loop that runs as long as x divides by i with no remainder.

within the loop, reassign x to the result of x divided by i

check if x equals i.  If it does, return true;

if x divided by i DOES have a remainder, and fails the nested while loop conditional, then increment i.

return false at the very end.
*/

/* top solution:
same quick check if n === 1, return true;

create a loop that intializes i as 2, runs conditionally if 'i' is less than
or equal to the square root of n, and a final expression of i++
-This loop's purpose is to test all the possible numbers 2 and the square root of n,
in order to power them by 'j' later.
-This was the correct way to not use a restrictive hard cap of '20' like i did.
Because the largest value of i will always be the number where that number multiplied
by itself, equals n.  (e.g for 144, 12 * 12.  Loop would run as long as i <= 12)

There is an inner for loop that initializes j as 2, and runs as long as
i ** j < n, and final expression of j++
-This loops purpose is to test all the possible powers in order to find when i ** j === n

pretty bad explanation but a sample run through;
n = 125, so 5**3 means that it would return true

i = 2,
i <= 11.180339887498949 (square root of 125)// true so continue loop

j=2
Math.pow(i, j) < n // 2 ** 2 === 4, and 4 < 125
so now j will keep incrementing as follows:
2 ** 2 // 4
2 ** 3 // 8
2 ** 4 // 16
2 ** 5 // 32
2 ** 6 // 64
2 ** 2 // 128 is greater than 125, so inner loop ends and
outter loop increments to 3,
and it goes through the same thing as above, like
3 ** 2
3 ** 3... etc.
After more iterations, it gets to 5 ** 3, and the conditional
in the nested for loop is true, so it returns true.

I'm not sure if this is slower, faster, or same as my solution.
Both have nested loops but the solutions outter loop condition is better.

Also a weird thing to note, is you can have a for loop without putting the code in a
code block?

the nested loop in the solution below has no code block and just
runs the below code as if it was in a code block.
I guess its similar to have you can have an 'if' conditional without a code block?
like:
if (true) return 'hello';

function isPower(n) {
    if (n == 1) return true;
    for (i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
        for (j = 2; Math.pow(i, j) < n; j++);
        if (Math.pow(i, j) == n) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
