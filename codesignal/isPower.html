/* description
Determine if the given number is a power of some non-negative integer.

Example

For n = 125, the output should be
isPower(n) = true;
For n = 72, the output should be
isPower(n) = false.
*/
    function isPower(n) {
        if (n === 1) return true;
        let i = 2
        while (i <= 20) {
          let x = n;
          while (x % i === 0) {
            x = x / i;
            if (x === i) {
              return true;
            };

        }
        return false;
      }

/* pseudocode
create a quick catch for if n === 1, return true;

initialize a storage named 'i', as 2.

create a loop that runs as long as i is less than or equal to 20
(n is a number between 0 and 401, so the largest possible value of i is 20,
since 20 * 20 = 400)
create a storage named 'x' and set it equal to 'n'

create nested loop that runs as long as x divides by i with no remainder.

within the loop, reassign x to the result of x divided by i

check if x equals i.  If it does, return true;

if x divided by i DOES have a remainder, and fails the nested while loop conditional, then increment i.

return false at the very end.
