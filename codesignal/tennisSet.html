/*
In tennis, the winner of a set is based on how many games each player wins. The first player to win 6 games is declared the winner unless their opponent had already won 5 games, in which case the set continues until one of the players has won 7 games.

Given two integers score1 and score2, your task is to determine if it is possible for a tennis set to be finished with a final score of score1 : score2.

Example

For score1 = 3 and score2 = 6, the output should be
tennisSet(score1, score2) = true.

Since player 1 hadn't reached 5 wins, the set ends once player 2 has won 6 games.

For score1 = 8 and score2 = 5, the output should be
tennisSet(score1, score2) = false.

Since both players won at least 5 games, the set would've ended once one of them won the 7th one.

For score1 = 6 and score2 = 5, the output should be
tennisSet(score1, score2) = false.

This set will continue until one of these players wins their 7th game, so this can't be the final score.
 */
    // this is not pretty...
    function tennisSet(score1, score2) {
        if (score1 > 7 || score2 > 7) return false;
        if (score1 === 7 || score2 === 7) {
          if (score1 === 5 || score1 === 6 || score2 === 5 || score2 === 6) {
            return true
          } else {
            return false
          }
        }
        if (score1 === 6 || score2 === 6) {
          if (score1 < 5 || score2 < 5) {
            return true
          } else {
            return false;
          }
        }
        return false;
      }

      rules:
      first player to 6 wins
      if other player already has 5, then first to 7 points.
      no player will EVER have more than 7 points
      No player will ever have more than 6 points if the other player has less than 5.

      pseudocode:
      check if either score is greater than 7.  immediately return no if it is.
      check if either score is 7, if it is, check if either score is 5 or 6.  return true if yes, false if no.
      check if either score is 6.  If it is, check if the other score is less than 5. return true if yes, false if no.

      return false by default
*/

/* top solution:
find the higher and lower score and set them to max and min respectively
test the two win conditions:
1. if someone has 6, the other person must have less than 5
2. if someone has 7, the other person must have more than 4, but less than 7
(must be 5 or 6)
these two tests are the same rules/win conditions I came up with,
but mine likes wayyyy fricken uglier.

function tennisSet(score1, score2) {
    var max = Math.max(score1, score2),
        min = Math.min(score1, score2);
    return  (max == 6 && min < 5) || (max == 7 && min >= 5 && min <=6);
}
