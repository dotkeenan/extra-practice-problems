      Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.

Example

For n = 1230, the output should be
isLucky(n) = true;
For n = 239017, the output should be
isLucky(n) = false.

best solution:
turns n into a string, then splits it, then maps over it and turns each digit back into a number (from a string)
iterates over the array of single digits and adds each digit to 'count' as long as 'i' is less than the half way point
if not, it minuses from 'count'.  Basically if by the end it is 0, then that means both halves are equal.
Not sure why using double equal instead of triple equal.

function isLucky(n) {
    var count = 0;
    n = String(n).split('').map(t => {return parseInt(t)});
    n.forEach( (el, i) => { (i < n.length / 2) ? count += el : count -= el });
    return count == 0;
}
