Notes
      n * n + (n-1)(n-1) // 2n^2 -2n + 1

Below we will define an n-interesting polygon. Your task is to find the area of a polygon for a given n.

A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting
polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending
1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. You can see the 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-interesting
polygons in the picture below.


Example

For n = 2, the output should be
shapeArea(n) = 5;
For n = 3, the output should be
shapeArea(n) = 13.
