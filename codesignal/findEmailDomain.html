/*
An email address such as "John.Smith@example.com" is made up of a local part ("John.Smith"), an "@" symbol, then a domain part ("example.com").

The domain name part of an email address may only consist of letters, digits, hyphens and dots. The local part, however, also allows a lot of different special characters. Here you can look at several examples of correct and incorrect email addresses.

Given a valid email address, find its domain part.

Example

For address = "prettyandsimple@example.com", the output should be
findEmailDomain(address) = "example.com";
For address = "fully-qualified-domain@codesignal.com", the output should be
findEmailDomain(address) = "codesignal.com".
 */
    function findEmailDomain(address) {
        const splitRegex = address.split(/\@/g)
        const domain = splitRegex[splitRegex.length - 1];
        const regex = /[\da-zA-Z\-\.]*\.?[com|ru|net|edu|org]/g
        const res = domain.match(regex)
        return res[0]
      }
/* pseudo code
      split the string at the LAST occurring '@'
      Will return an array with two elements, the local part, and the domain part.
      store array[array.length - 1]

      use regex to capture the _________.com/ru/org/edu part.
      match() returns an array, so return array[0]
