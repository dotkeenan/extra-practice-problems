Let's define digit degree of some positive integer as the number of times we need to replace this number with the sum of its digits until we get to a one digit number.

Given an integer, find its digit degree.

Example

For n = 5, the output should be
digitDegree(n) = 0;
For n = 100, the output should be
digitDegree(n) = 1.
1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
For n = 91, the output should be
digitDegree(n) = 2.
9 + 1 = 10 -> 1 + 0 = 1.
*/
    function digitDegree(n) {
        let count = 0;
        let value = n.toString();
        while (value.length > 1) {
          value = [...value.toString()].reduce((a, b) => Number(a) + Number(b)).toString();
          count++;
        }
        return count;
      }
/* Pseudocode
Create a storage to count the number of times it takes to reach a 1 digit number, named 'count'
Create a storage for the current value of 'n' after summing its digits, named 'value'.
    Assign n.toString() as its starting value.

Create a loop that continues to run as long as value.length > 1.
within the loop:
turn the number into a string, and split it up by single digits.
assign 'value' to: the sum of all of array elements together but also convert them to number during the process.
Turn the result back into a string, and assign this value to 'value'
increment 'count'

return count

/*
top js solution (only 3 votes) basically same as mine
He/she mutates n instead of assigning n to a variable.

function digitDegree(n) {
    c = 0
    while (n.toString().length>1) {
        n = n.toString().split("").reduce((x,y)=>Number(x)+Number(y))
        c++}
    return c}
