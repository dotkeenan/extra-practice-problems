/*
      create the matrix

      define the bounds of the matrix: top bottom left right

      create a counter variable that stores which number should be added next to the matrix, initialized at 1

      create a size variable that stores the max amount of matrix elements there will be for that function call.

      create a loop that runs as long as the amount of values added to the matrix <= the max amount of
      values that can be in the matrix (n * n) since its a square.

      within the loop:

      create nested loops that iterate around each side of the matrix, assigning the values to counter.
      End the loop once it reaches the appropriate bound.  Also check if counter <= size.
      increment counter after each assignment

      after a row is complete, increment or decrement the bounds appropriately so that
      matrix positions won't be overwritten once they are assigned.

      return matrix
