    /* In order to stop the Mad Coder evil genius you need to decipher the encrypted message he sent to his minions. The message contains several numbers that, when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missile into the sky blocking out the sun, and making all the people on Earth grumpy and sad.

You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their binary representation. More specifically, in the given number n the kth bit from the right was initially set to 0, but its current value might be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the kth bit of n back to 0.

Example

For n = 37 and k = 3, the output should be
killKthBit(n, k) = 33.

3710 = 1001012 ~> 1000012 = 3310.

For n = 37 and k = 4, the output should be
killKthBit(n, k) = 37.

The 4th bit is 0 already (looks like the Mad Coder forgot to encrypt this number), so the answer is still 37. */
    function killKthBit(n, k) {
        return n & ~(1 << k - 1);
      }
/* notes:
       & Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.  If one is 1 and the other is 0, it changes it to 0.
       ~ inverts all the bits
      << Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
      k-1 is due to the fact that you want the kth bit, but you start at 1, not 0, so you need to -1 to compensate for the offset

      return n and (set each bit to 1 if both bits are 1) the opposite of the bit at the kth bit.
      so if n = 37, that converts to 100101.
      we want to convert the kth bit to 0 if it is 1, but ignore it if it's already 0.
      & ~(bit selection) basically flips the bit of whatever it was at that kth position.
      I dont understand tho, if it's a 0, won't it get inverted to 1?
      And what if n happens to be 1, then both 1's would return a 1 due to &.
