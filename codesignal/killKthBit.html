    /* In order to stop the Mad Coder evil genius you need to decipher the encrypted message he sent to his minions. The message contains several numbers that, when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missile into the sky blocking out the sun, and making all the people on Earth grumpy and sad.

You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their binary representation. More specifically, in the given number n the kth bit from the right was initially set to 0, but its current value might be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the kth bit of n back to 0.

Example

For n = 37 and k = 3, the output should be
killKthBit(n, k) = 33.

3710 = 1001012 ~> 1000012 = 3310.

For n = 37 and k = 4, the output should be
killKthBit(n, k) = 37.

The 4th bit is 0 already (looks like the Mad Coder forgot to encrypt this number), so the answer is still 37. */
    function killKthBit(n, k) {
        return n & ~(1 << k - 1);
      }
/* notes:
 & Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.  If one is 1 and the other is 0, it changes it to 0.
 ~ inverts all the bits
<< Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
k-1 is due to the fact that you want the kth bit, but you start with 1 (1 in bitwise is just ...0001) so you need to -1 to compensate for the offset

return n and (set each bit to 1 if both bits are 1) the opposite of the bit at the kth bit.
so if n = 37, that converts to 100101.
and if k=3, (1 << k-1) converts to 100

we want to convert the kth bit to 0 if it is 1, but ignore it if it's already 0.
& ~(bit selection) basically flips value of every bit in the (1 << k-1), so 100 becomes 011.

so in the end we have the epression 100101 & 011
since & only returns a 1 if both bits in the same place are 1,
it evaluates to 100001, which converts to 33.
