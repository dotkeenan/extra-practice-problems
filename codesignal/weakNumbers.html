We define the weakness of number x as the number of positive integers smaller than x that have more divisors than x.

It follows that the weaker the number, the greater overall weakness it has. For the given integer n, you need to answer two questions:

what is the weakness of the weakest numbers in the range [1, n]?
how many numbers in the range [1, n] have this weakness?
Return the answer as an array of two elements, where the first element is the answer to the first question, and the second element is the answer to the second question.

Example

For n = 9, the output should be
weakNumbers(n) = [2, 2].

Here are the number of divisors and the specific weakness of each number in range [1, 9]:

1: d(1) = 1, weakness(1) = 0;
2: d(2) = 2, weakness(2) = 0;
3: d(3) = 2, weakness(3) = 0;
4: d(4) = 3, weakness(4) = 0;
5: d(5) = 2, weakness(5) = 1;
6: d(6) = 4, weakness(6) = 0;
7: d(7) = 2, weakness(7) = 2;
8: d(8) = 4, weakness(8) = 0;
9: d(9) = 3, weakness(9) = 2.
As you can see, the maximal weakness is 2, and there are 2 numbers with that weakness level.

/*
      create storage for the amt of all the divisors for each number between 1 and n, named divisorAmts
      create storage for the amt of weaknesses each number between 1 and n has, named weaknesses

      create a loop that iterates over all the numbers between/including 1 and n.
      in the loop:
      create a storage to keep track of the amt of weaknesses the current iteration of 'i' has, named weaknessCount
      create a new Set named divisors, to only allow unique values into it.
      create a nested loop that iterates over all the numbers between/including 1 and i/2 rounded upwards
      -this is to find all the possible unique divisors that 'i' has.  No need to go all the way up to i, since divisors will begin repeat themselves after the halfway point (e.g for 6, it would find 2*3 then 3*2)
      inside nested loop:
          if 'i' divided by 'j' has no remainder, then they are divisors and should be added to the set.
      after nested loop:
      push the size of the 'divisors' set to divisorAmts

      Find how many weaknesses each iteration of 'i' has (a weakness is when a previous iteration of 'i' has more divisors than the current iteration of 'i')
      iterate over each of divisorAmts elements and compare to see if there are any elements that are greater than the
      amount of the current iterations divisors.
      If there are, increment weaknessCount

      push weaknessCount into weaknesses in order to keep track of all the iterations of i's weaknesses.

      Return an array with two elements: the largest number within the weaknesses storage,
      and the amount of times that weakness appears.

/* top solution:
Find divisors section:
clever way to create an object that just increments a counter one time
whenever i / j has no remainder.  It takes into account the fact that there
will always be dual pairs, like 2*3 and 3*2, so it increments 1 time for each
for a total of 2 divisors.

Find Weaknesses section:
uses a while loop with a nested for loop that compares m[n] < m[l]
at this point, m is an object that looks like:
{
  1:1,
  2:2,
  3:2,
  4:3,
  5:2,
  6:4,
  7:2,
  8:4,
  9:3
}
So it starts by comparing m[9] // 3, with m[8] // 4
m[8] is greater so count++ (count is the weakness counter)
the nested loop goes all the way down until m[1], so it checks if each
past iteration has more divisors.
After that, it pushes count into arr, which stores all the weaknesses,
resets count (since its just a temporary counter for each iteration),
and decrements n, so the next iteration of the while loop will start by
comparing m[8] < m[7].

Find weakest and its quantity section:
Simply just finds the largest weakness with Math.max
Interesting approach to find that amount of times the largest weakness appears:
uses a for in loop to iterate over the array and finds where the current iteration
is equal to the largest weakness, then increments count.
They re-used the same 'count' variable that was used in the while loop to
store each individual iteration of i's weakness.
Not sure if this is good or bad... re-using the same variable for two different purposes.

 weakNumbers=(n)=> {
    let count = 0;
    let m = {};
    let arr=[];

// Find divisiors
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        m[i] = 0;
        for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            if (i % j === 0) m[i]++;
        }
    }

// Find Weakness
    while (n > 0) {
        for (let l = n - 1; l > 0; l--) {
            if (m[n] < m[l]) count++;
        }
        arr.push(count);
        count=0;
        n--;
    }

// Find weakest and its quantity
    let weakness = Math.max(...arr);
    for (let k in arr){
      if(weakness === arr[k]) count++;
    }
    return [weakness,count]
}
