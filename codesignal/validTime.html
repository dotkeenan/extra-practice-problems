/* description
Check if the given string is a correct time representation of the 24-hour clock.

Example

For time = "13:58", the output should be
validTime(time) = true;
For time = "25:51", the output should be
validTime(time) = false;
For time = "02:76", the output should be
validTime(time) = false.
*/
    function validTime(time) {
        const splitTime = time.split(':')
        const hour = 0 <= Number(splitTime[0]) && Number(splitTime[0]) <= 23;
        const min = 0 <= Number(splitTime[1]) && Number(splitTime[1]) <= 59;
        return hour && min
      }
/* pseudo code
split the time at the colon, so we are left with an array filled with two elements:
the hour-time as a string, and the minute-time as a string.

Take the hour-time, convert it to a number, return boolean true/false, if the number
is between 0 and 23 (inclusively) and store the result of the expression in storage
named 'hour'

Take min-time, convert it to a number, return boolean true/false, if the number
is between 0 and 59 (inclusively), and store the result of the expression in storage
named 'min'

return the result of if 'hour' and 'min' are both truthy.

/* top solution:
regex approach
^ // first capture group must start with:
a digit between 0-1 (this is the hour but only 00 - 19)
it can be followed by any digit 0-9, so only hours from 00 - 19
-OR-
it can start with a 2, followed by a digit between 0 - 3, so hrs 20-23

Then it must match a semi colon.
Then the regex for the minutes:
must be a digit between 0 - 5 // ie 00 - 59 (the ten's place for minutes)
$ signifies it must end with:
any digit 0 - 9  (the one's place for minutes)

It runs the test(t) regex string method to test whether the match is true or not.

validTime = t => /^([0-1]\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\d$/.test(t);


2nd top solution:
Kind of similar to my approach
splits the string into hours and minutes
tests if hours is less than 24, and if minutes is less than 60.
This is a lazier approach that just happens to work with the test
cases.  It would fail if there were negative hours or minutes.

function validTime(t) {
    return t.split(":")[0] < 24 && t.split(":")[1] < 60
  }
