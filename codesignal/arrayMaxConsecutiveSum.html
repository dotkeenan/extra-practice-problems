    // first attempt
    function arrayMaxConsecutiveSum(inputArray, k) {
        let max = -Infinity;
        let currentSum = 0;
        for (let i = k - 1; i < inputArray.length; i++) {
          currentSum = 0;
          for (let j = 1; j < k; j++) {
            currentSum += inputArray[i - j];
          }
          if (inputArray[i] + currentSum > max) {
            max = inputArray[i] + currentSum;
          }
        }

/* pseudo code
make storage for the max consecutive sum.
make storage for the current iterated consecutive sum.
Find a way to make loop dynamically stop based on 'k'
meaning, if the array is [1,2,3,4] and k = 3, it should only iterate twice: [1,2,3] and [2,3,4]
first loop starts at k-1 and stops at inputArray.length.  if inputArray = [1,2,3,4,5] and k=3,
it would start at index position 2 (which is the 3rd element).

2nd forLoop is to dynamically sum the consecutive elements.
Start the loop at 1, because we want to first get inputArray[i-1] and we want that 1 to increment until it reaches k amount.
Note we end at j < k because we need to offset the index.

In the loop I use addition assignment to sum the consecutive elements that are not inputArray[i]
Afterwards, lowest will be assigned to the entire sum IF it is larger than lowest (which starts at -Infinity).

/*
top solution:
use slice to get the group of consecutive numbers.
reduce them in order to sum them up.
This first summed group is assigned to 'prev'
'prev' is also assigned to 'max' to just give it a starting value.

Make a loop that iterates over inputArray but starts at 'k' and ends at
inputArray.length.  This part is similar to my approach.
(It starts ahead, and grabs the consecutive values before it, vs starting
at the [0] and getting the consecutive values after it, avoiding issues
of exceeding the length of the array)

at this point, 'prev' and 'max' === 6;
so in the for loop, prev gets re-assigned to:
6 - inputArray[3-3] + inputArray[3] or 6-1+4 (9)
A bit confusing what is happening here, but Basically,
on each iteration, it subtracts the left most value from the summed group,
then adds the new right most value.
Visually, its like this:
first iteration: [(1+3+2), 4], second iteration: [1, (3+2+4)]
Since the consecutive group of 3 keeps moving right on each iteration,
it subtracts the left most value from the sum, and adds the next new right most
value to the sum.

Then there is a simple conditional which reassigns 'max' if 'prev' is larger than it


example: inputArray = [1,3,2,4] k = 3
function arrayMaxConsecutiveSum(inputArray, k){
  let prev = inputArray.slice(0,k).reduce((x,y) => x+y, 0);
  let max = prev;
  for(let i = k; i < inputArray.length; i++){
      prev = prev - inputArray[i-k] + inputArray[i];
  if(prev > max) max = prev;
  }
  return max;
}
