      /* pseudo code
      make storage for the max consecutive sum.
      make storage for the current iterated consecutive sum.
      Find a way to make loop dynamically stop based on 'k'
      meaning, if the array is [1,2,3,4] and k = 3, it should only iterate twice: [1,2,3] and [2,3,4]
      first loop starts at k-1 and stops at inputArray.length.  if inputArray = [1,2,3,4,5] and k=3,
      it would start at index position 2 (which is the 3rd element).

      2nd forLoop is to dynamically sum the consecutive elements.
      Start the loop at 1, because we want to first get inputArray[i-1] and we want that 1 to increment until it reaches k amount.
      Note we end at j < k because we need to offset the index.

      In the loop I use addition assignment to sum the consecutive elements that are not inputArray[i]
      Afterwards, lowest will be assigned to the entire sum IF it is larger than lowest (which starts at -Infinity).
