/* description
One night you go for a ride on your motorcycle. At 00:00 you start your engine, and the built-in timer automatically begins counting the length of your ride, in minutes. Off you go to explore the neighborhood.

When you finally decide to head back, you realize there's a chance the bridges on your route home are up, leaving you stranded! Unfortunately, you don't have your watch on you and don't know what time it is. All you know thanks to the bike's timer is that n minutes have passed since 00:00.

Using the bike's timer, calculate the current time. Return an answer as the sum of digits that the digital timer in the format hh:mm would show.

Example

For n = 240, the output should be
lateRide(n) = 4.

Since 240 minutes have passed, the current time is 04:00. The digits sum up to 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 4, which is the answer.

For n = 808, the output should be
lateRide(n) = 14.

808 minutes mean that it's 13:28 now, so the answer should be 1 + 3 + 2 + 8 = 14.
*/
    function lateRide(n) {
        const minutes = (n % 60).toString()
        const hours = (Math.floor(n / 60)).toString()
        const res = [...minutes.split(''), ...hours.split('')]
        return res.reduce((a, b) => Number(a) + Number(b))
      }
/* top solution:
uses bitwise or in order to smartly deal with finding out how many whole hours
there are when diving the total minutes by 60.
it returns the largest integer thats inputted, so even if you have 179 minutes,
179/ 60 | 0 will return 2, even though 179/60 === 2.983333

Then finds the leftover minutes with n % 60.

then just returns expressions that evaluate the necessary pieces of time.
each portion is a way to extract the individual digit (accounting for if
the hours or minutes has 2 digits)

hours / 10 | 0 // gets the 10's place if the hour is 10, 11, 12.  Would return 1
if it were any of those hours.

hours % 10 // gets the 1's place for hours 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  It would return the
hour digit, since using a modulous in which the 1st num < 2nd num just equates to
the 1st num.

minutes / 10 | 0 // same as hours above.  Gets the 10's place number.

minutes % 10 // same as above, gets the 1's place number.

function lateRide(n) {
    var hours = n / 60 | 0,
        minutes = n % 60;
    return (hours / 10 | 0) + hours % 10 + (minutes / 10 | 0) + minutes % 10;
}
