/* brainstorm/ pseudocode
create a storage named pow initialized at 10, to store the power which will be used to
modulous n by.
create storage named res initialized at 0, to store the result

create a while loop that runs as long as n % pow does not equal n.
(basically loop will stop once power gets too large.  A power larger larger than n will just return n when using modulous.)

in the loop:
if the remainder of n divided by pow is less than 5 * (pow/10) // due to the multiplcation assignment of pow, in the code block, need to revert pow back to a lower power of 10 before it was increased.  (hard to explain, just need to console log n % pow < 5 to see that it doesn't work that way)

assign n the remainder of n divided by pow

if remainder of n divided by pow is equal or grather than 5,
assign n the result of n minus the remainder of n divided by pow
assign n the result of pow multiplied by 1

after either if or else, multiply and assign 10 to pow.

return n
