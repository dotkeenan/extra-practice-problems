/* description
We want to turn the given integer into a number that has only one non-zero digit using a tail rounding approach. This means that at each step we take the last non 0 digit of the number and round it to 0 or to 10. If it's less than 5 we round it to 0 if it's larger than or equal to 5 we round it to 10 (rounding to 10 means increasing the next significant digit by 1). The process stops immediately once there is only one non-zero digit left.

Example

For n = 15, the output should be
rounders(n) = 20;

For n = 1234, the output should be
rounders(n) = 1000.

1234 -> 1230 -> 1200 -> 1000.

For n = 1445, the output should be
rounders(n) = 2000.

1445 -> 1450 -> 1500 -> 2000.
*/
      function rounders(n) {
        let pow = 10;
        let res = 0;
        while (n % pow !== n) {
          if (n % pow < 5 * (pow / 10)) {
            n -= n % pow
          } else {
            n -= n % pow
            n += pow * 1
          }
          pow *= 10
        }
        return n;
      }
/* brainstorm/ pseudocode
create a storage named pow initialized at 10, to store the power which will be used to
modulous n by.
create storage named res initialized at 0, to store the result

create a while loop that runs as long as n % pow does not equal n.
(basically loop will stop once power gets too large.  A power larger larger than n will just return n when using modulous.)

in the loop:
if the remainder of n divided by pow is less than 5 * (pow/10) // due to the multiplcation assignment of pow, in the code block, need to revert pow back to a lower power of 10 before it was increased.  (hard to explain, just need to console log n % pow < 5 to see that it doesn't work that way)

assign n the remainder of n divided by pow

if remainder of n divided by pow is equal or grather than 5,
assign n the result of n minus the remainder of n divided by pow
assign n the result of pow multiplied by 1

after either if or else, multiply and assign 10 to pow.

return n
