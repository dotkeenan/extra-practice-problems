You work in a company that prints and publishes books. You are responsible for designing the page numbering mechanism in the printer. You know how many digits a printer can print with the leftover ink. Now you want to write a function to determine what the last page of the book is that you can number given the current page and numberOfDigits left. A page is considered numbered if it has the full number printed on it (e.g. if we are working with page 102 but have ink only for two digits then this page will not be considered numbered).

It's guaranteed that you can number the current page, and that you can't number the last one in the book.

Example

For current = 1 and numberOfDigits = 5, the output should be
pagesNumberingWithInk(current, numberOfDigits) = 5.

The following numbers will be printed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

For current = 21 and numberOfDigits = 5, the output should be
pagesNumberingWithInk(current, numberOfDigits) = 22.

The following numbers will be printed: 21, 22.

For current = 8 and numberOfDigits = 4, the output should be
pagesNumberingWithInk(current, numberOfDigits) = 10.

The following numbers will be printed: 8, 9, 10.

    function pagesNumberingWithInk(current, numberOfDigits) {
        let usedDigits = 0;
        while (usedDigits <= numberOfDigits) {
          let currDigiAmt = current.toString().length
          let nextDigiAmt = (current + 1).toString().length
          usedDigits += currDigiAmt

          if (usedDigits + nextDigiAmt > numberOfDigits) {
            return current;
          }
          current++;
        }
      }
/* pseudocode
create a storage named usedDigits, initialized as 0.  Used to store how many digits have been used already.

create a loop that runs as long as the usedDigits is less than or equal to numberOfDigits
inside the loop:

create storage named currDigitAmt in order to store the amount of digits that 'current' has.

create a storage named nextDigitAmt to store the amount of digits that the number after 'current' has.

add and assign currDigitAmt to usedDigits

Create a conditional that will return current, if usedDigits + nextDigitAmt is greater than numberOfDigits
-This will return the last number I will be able to print, before we run out of ink, because it checks if the next page's digits will exceed the amount of digits worth of ink I have left.

increment current to the next number.
*/

/* description:
creates a while loop that runs as long as numberOfDigits >= the length of 'current'.
reassign numberOfDigits to numberOfDigits - the length of 'current'
-This idea is like we have a physical supply of digits, and whenever we use some up,
we subtract from our supply.

increment current.

return current - 1;
since when the incrementation of current always happens at the end, even if we don't have
enough ink to print it, once it fails the while loop conditional, we will return the
number before it caused the while loop condition to fail, aka current - 1.

function pagesNumberingWithInk(current, numberOfDigits) {
    while (numberOfDigits >= current.toString().length) {
        numberOfDigits -= current.toString().length;
        current++;
    }
    return current - 1;
}
