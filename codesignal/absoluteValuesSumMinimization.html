Given a sorted array of integers a, your task is to determine which element of a is closest to all other values of a. In other words, find the element x in a, which minimizes the following sum:

abs(a[0] - x) + abs(a[1] - x) + ... + abs(a[a.length - 1] - x)
(where abs denotes the absolute value)

If there are several possible answers, output the smallest one.

Example

For a = [2, 4, 7], the output should be absoluteValuesSumMinimization(a) = 4.

for x = 2, the value will be abs(2 - 2) + abs(4 - 2) + abs(7 - 2) = 7.
for x = 4, the value will be abs(2 - 4) + abs(4 - 4) + abs(7 - 4) = 5.
for x = 7, the value will be abs(2 - 7) + abs(4 - 7) + abs(7 - 7) = 8.
The lowest possible value is when x = 4, so the answer is 4.

For a = [2, 3], the output should be absoluteValuesSumMinimization(a) = 2.

for x = 2, the value will be abs(2 - 2) + abs(3 - 2) = 1.
for x = 3, the value will be abs(2 - 3) + abs(3 - 3) = 1.
Because there is a tie, the smallest x between x = 2 and x = 3 is the answer.

    const absoluteValuesSumMinimization = (a) => {
        const res = [];
        a.forEach(num => {
          const sum = a.reduce((acc, next) => {
            return acc + Math.abs(next - num);
          }, 0);
          res.push(sum)
        })
        const lowest = Math.min(...res);
        return a[res.indexOf(lowest)]
      }

My explanation:
The hard part of this was just the logic behind finding out which number
in 'a' has the least distance between all the other values.
This is done by summing up all the absolute differences between the testing value
(like a[0]) and the rest of them (like a[i] in a loop);

* create a variable to hold an array of all the summed differences.
* use a forEach to iterate over 'a' (this will be a way to test each number
individually, against all the others, include itself, which is just gonna be 0)
* In the forEach, create a storage for the result of the reduce() on 'a'.
* reduce() is what is used to sum up all the differences.
* the reduce gets passed a second argument of '0' which sets acc's initial
value as 0.
* Once all the values are reduced (summed up), it pushes it to 'res' arr.
* In the end, res will house the summed up absolute differences.
      if a = [2,4,7], then res = [7,5,8]
* The two arrays are basically paralell in a sense that a[0] corresponds with res[0]
* So I just find the lowest value within res, then find the index of that lowest value,
and use that as the index of 'a'.  (this works due to what i said above about
the two arrays being parallel)

top solution:
No clue how or why this works...
all it does is take the length of the argument array, divide it in 2, round up,
and minus 1 from it.
The reason for the -1 thing is due to indexing offset. for an array with an even
amt of elements, it would be offset.  Aka, if a.length === 4,
then half of that is 2, and a[2] is actually the 3rd element of the array.
The Math.ceil is for odd numbered a.lengths, since 3/2 is 1.5.  So it rounds it up to 2.
Again, due to indexing it, it needs to be offset by -1.

But even after all of that... I don't see how that finds the value that has the
smallest sum of distances between each value...  It literally is just a way to find
the median of the array elements.

function absoluteValuesSumMinimization(A) {
    return A[Math.ceil(A.length/2)-1];
}
