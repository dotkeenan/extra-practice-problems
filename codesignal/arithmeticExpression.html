/*
Consider an arithmetic expression of the form a#b=c. Check whether it is possible to replace # with one of the four signs: +, -, * or / to obtain a correct expression.

Example

For a = 2, b = 3, and c = 5, the output should be
arithmeticExpression(a, b, c) = true.

We can replace # with a + to obtain 2 + 3 = 5, so the answer is true.

For a = 8, b = 2, and c = 4, the output should be
arithmeticExpression(a, b, c) = true.

We can replace # with a / to obtain 8 / 2 = 4, so the answer is true.

For a = 8, b = 3, and c = 2, the output should be
arithmeticExpression(a, b, c) = false.

8 + 3 = 11 ≠ 2;
8 - 3 = 5 ≠ 2;
8 * 3 = 24 ≠ 2;
8 / 3 = 2.(6) ≠ 2.
So the answer is false.

      create an object named ops, that stores each operator as a key, and its respective function as a value.
