/*
Given a string, return its encoding defined as follows:

First, the string is divided into the least possible number of disjoint substrings consisting of identical characters
for example, "aabbbc" is divided into ["aa", "bbb", "c"]
Next, each substring with length greater than one is replaced with a concatenation of its length and the repeating character
for example, substring "bbb" is replaced by "3b"
Finally, all the new strings are concatenated together in the same order and a new string is returned.

create storage for temporary string creation initialized at s[0], named tempStr
create an empty array to store each finished tempStr, named 'res'

iterate over the string starting at i = 1, runs as long as i is less than s.length, increments by 1 each loop.

if s[i] is the same as s[i - 1], then concatenate tempStr with s[i]
if they are NOT the same, push tempStr into res and set tempStr equal to s[i]

once res contains all the identical character substrings,
iterate over res using a map() in order to change each value accordingly
within the map, if current iterations length is greater than 1, then concatenation it's length
with it's value at the 0th index.

join res('') with an empty string and return.

// top solution:
/* 1st Capturing Group(.)
. - matches any character(except for line terminators)
\1 - matches the same text as most recently matched by the 1st capturing group
* - matches the previous token between zero and unlimited times, as many times
as possible, giving back as needed (greedy)

in example s = 'aabbbc'
so the regex matches 3 groups, the 'aa', 'bbb', 'c'
it replaces it with the result of a ternary:
(i guess callback functions inside of replace() have the element and index available
to them?
e = the match, i = the group.)
if the match === the group, then just return the match. (so like if the match is just
a single character like 'c', it will just return 'c')
if the match does not equal the group (like 'bbb' !== 'b'), it returns the
concatenation of the length of the match + the group, so '3b'

I had thought of regex but did not know how to execute it.  Did not know
about back referencing, or how the replacer function within the replace() works, or
which arguments it has access to.
