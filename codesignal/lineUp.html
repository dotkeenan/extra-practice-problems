/* description
To prepare his students for an upcoming game, the sports coach decides to try some new training drills. To begin with, he lines them up and starts with the following warm-up exercise: when the coach says 'L', he instructs the students to turn to the left. Alternatively, when he says 'R', they should turn to the right. Finally, when the coach says 'A', the students should turn around.

Unfortunately some students (not all of them, but at least one) can't tell left from right, meaning they always turn right when they hear 'L' and left when they hear 'R'. The coach wants to know how many times the students end up facing the same direction.

Given the list of commands the coach has given, count the number of such commands after which the students will be facing the same direction.

Example

For commands = "LLARL", the output should be
lineUp(commands) = 3.

Let's say that there are 4 students, and the second one can't tell left from right. In this case, only after the second, third and fifth commands will the students face the same direction.
*/
function lineUp(commands) {
    let smart = 0, dumb = 0, counter = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < commands.length; i++) {
      if (commands[i] === 'L') {
        smart -= 1;
        dumb += 1;
      } else if (commands[i] === 'R') {
        smart += 1;
        dumb -= 1;
      } else {
        smart += 2;
        dumb += 2;
      }
      if (smart % 2 === 0 && dumb % 2 === 0) counter++;
    }
    return counter;
  }

/*
rules:
if turning 2x same direction, they will all face the same way
if turn 1x in one direction, but then 1x in the other, they will all face the same way
if A, all reset and face the same way.

make a system in which turning left is -1 for smart (+1 for dumb)
turning right is + 1 for smart, -1 for dumb.
turning around is + 2

create variables representing smart and dumb students,
initialized at 0, representing their starting point.
create a counter variable initialized at 0, representing the amt of times a move makes all students face the same way.

they are all facing the same way when:
there is no remainder when dividing by 2?

loop over the commands string.
Create 3 'if' scenarios to run when a command is either 'L', 'R', or 'A'
If current letter is L, smart students -1, dumb +1
if R, smart student +1 dumb -1
if A, both smart and dumb +2

at the end of each iteration, check if smart and dumb students have no remainder when dividing by 2, and if true, increase counter by 1.

return counter when the loop is finished.

*/

/* top solution:
creates a storage named result to count amt of same facing moves.
create storage named 'same' to store the status whether all students
are facing same directions or not.

loop over command string
Basically if command[i] is ever 'L' or 'R', it will toggle/flip
the status of 'same'
This kind of achieves the same thing as my method of checking whether
both stupid and smart students divided by 2 has no remainder.

And when 'same' is truthy, then increment 'result'
So when command[i] === 'A', pretty much there is no code that addresses it
but the previous code causes it to either do nothing, or to increment result, if
it's already truthy.
-So if students are facing same way, then 'A' comes up, then it causes students
to face the same way again.

function lineUp(commands) {
    var result = 0,
        same = true;
    for (var i = 0; i < commands.length; i++) {
        var command = commands[i];
        if (command == 'L' || command == 'R') {
            same = !same;
        }
        if (same) result++;
    }
    return result;
}
