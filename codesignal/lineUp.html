/* description
To prepare his students for an upcoming game, the sports coach decides to try some new training drills. To begin with, he lines them up and starts with the following warm-up exercise: when the coach says 'L', he instructs the students to turn to the left. Alternatively, when he says 'R', they should turn to the right. Finally, when the coach says 'A', the students should turn around.

Unfortunately some students (not all of them, but at least one) can't tell left from right, meaning they always turn right when they hear 'L' and left when they hear 'R'. The coach wants to know how many times the students end up facing the same direction.

Given the list of commands the coach has given, count the number of such commands after which the students will be facing the same direction.

Example

For commands = "LLARL", the output should be
lineUp(commands) = 3.

Let's say that there are 4 students, and the second one can't tell left from right. In this case, only after the second, third and fifth commands will the students face the same direction.
*/
    function lineUp(commands) {
        let smart = 0, dumb = 0, counter = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < commands.length; i++) {
          if (commands[i] === 'L') {
            smart -= 1;
            dumb += 1;
          } else if (commands[i] === 'R') {
            smart += 1;
            dumb -= 1;
          } else {
            smart += 2;
            dumb += 2;
          }
          if (smart % 2 === 0 && dumb % 2 === 0) counter++;
        }
        return counter;
      }

      /*
      rules:
      if turning 2x same direction, they will all face the same way
      if turn 1x in one direction, but then 1x in the other, they will all face the same way
      if A, all reset and face the same way.

      make a system in which turning left is -1 for smart (+1 for dumb)
      turning right is + 1 for smart, -1 for dumb.
      turning around is + 2

      create variables representing smart and dumb students,
      initialized at 0, representing their starting point.
      create a counter variable initialized at 0, representing the amt of times a move makes all students face the same way.

      they are all facing the same way when:
      there is no remainder when dividing by 2?

      loop over the commands string.
      Create 3 'if' scenarios to run when a command is either 'L', 'R', or 'A'
      If current letter is L, smart students -1, dumb +1
      if R, smart student +1 dumb -1
      if A, both smart and dumb +2

      at the end of each iteration, check if smart and dumb students have no remainder when dividing by 2, and if true, increase counter by 1.

      return counter when the loop is finished.
