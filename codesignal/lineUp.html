      rules:
      if turning 2x same direction, they will all face the same way
      if turn 1x in one direction, but then 1x in the other, they will all face the same way
      if A, all reset and face the same way.

      make a system in which turning left is -1 for smart (+1 for dumb)
      turning right is + 1 for smart, -1 for dumb.
      turning around is + 2

      create variables representing smart and dumb students,
      initialized at 0, representing their starting point.
      create a counter variable initialized at 0, representing the amt of times a move makes all students face the same way.

      they are all facing the same way when:
      there is no remainder when dividing by 2?

      loop over the commands string.
      Create 3 'if' scenarios to run when a command is either 'L', 'R', or 'A'
      If current letter is L, smart students -1, dumb +1
      if R, smart student +1 dumb -1
      if A, both smart and dumb +2

      at the end of each iteration, check if smart and dumb students have no remainder when dividing by 2, and if true, increase counter by 1.

      return counter when the loop is finished.
