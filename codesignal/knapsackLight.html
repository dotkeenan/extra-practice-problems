/*
You found two items in a treasure chest! The first item weighs weight1 and is worth value1, and the second item weighs weight2 and is worth value2. What is the total maximum value of the items you can take with you, assuming that your max weight capacity is maxW and you can't come back for the items later?

Note that there are only two items and you can't bring more than one item of each type, i.e. you can't take two first items or two second items.

Example

For value1 = 10, weight1 = 5, value2 = 6, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 8, the output should be
knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 10.

You can only carry the first item.

For value1 = 10, weight1 = 5, value2 = 6, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 9, the output should be
knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 16.

You're strong enough to take both of the items with you.

For value1 = 5, weight1 = 3, value2 = 7, weight2 = 4, and maxW = 6, the output should be
knapsackLight(value1, weight1, value2, weight2, maxW) = 7.

You can't take both items, but you can take any of them.

        const minV = Math.min(value1, value2);

        const keyMinV = Object.keys(treasures).find(key => treasures[key] === minV);

        if (weight1 > maxW && weight2 > maxW) return 0;

/* top solution:
Uses logical && for conditional.
Takes the max of the 3 values:
if maxW >= weight1, then return value 1
if maxW >= weight2, then return value 2
if maxW >= weight1 + weight2, then return value1 + value2.
