/* description
Given a divisor and a bound, find the largest integer N such that:

N is divisible by divisor.
N is less than or equal to bound.
N is greater than 0.
It is guaranteed that such a number exists.

Example

For divisor = 3 and bound = 10, the output should be
maxMultiple(divisor, bound) = 9.

The largest integer divisible by 3 and not larger than 10 is 9.
*/
    function maxMultiple(divisor, bound) {
        for (let i = bound; i >= divisor; i--) {
          if (i % divisor === 0) return i;
        }
      }

/* top solution
take the remainder of the bound divided by the divisor.
subtract that result from the bound.
Then you are left with the largest number that is divisible by the divisor.

function maxMultiple(divisor, bound) {
return bound - (bound % divisor);
}
