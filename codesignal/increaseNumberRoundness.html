/* description
Define an integer's roundness as the number of trailing zeroes in it.

Given an integer n, check if it's possible to increase n's roundness by swapping some pair of its digits.

Example

For n = 902200100, the output should be
increaseNumberRoundness(n) = true.

One of the possible ways to increase roundness of n is to swap digit 1 with digit 0 preceding it: roundness of 902201000 is 3, and roundness of n is 2.

For instance, one may swap the leftmost 0 with 1.

For n = 11000, the output should be
increaseNumberRoundness(n) = false.

Roundness of n is 3, and there is no way to increase it.
 */
    function increaseNumberRoundness(n) {
        let nString = n.toString()
        for (let i = 1; i < nString.length - 1; i++) {
          if (nString[i] === '0' && nString[i - 1] !== '0' && nString[i + 1] !== '0') {
            return true;
          }
        }
        return false;
      }
/* brainstorm
need to check if there are any non-trailing zeros.
if there is, then return false.

If there is a non-trailing zero, you should always be able to swap it with the right most
non-zero digit to increase its roundness.

*/

/* pseudocode
convert n to a string and loop over it.
start at i = 1 and continue as long as i < nString.length - 1
if nString[i] is string 0, check if nString[i - 1] and nString[i+1] are string, non-zero numbers.

If they are, then return true.
else return false.

*/

/* top solution
uses regex and tests if a 1-9 digit ever follows a 0.
if it does, return true, else false.

function increaseNumberRoundness(n) {
    return /0[1-9]/.test(n);
}
