/*
Given a position of a knight on the standard chessboard, find the number of
different moves the knight can perform.

The knight can move to a square that is two squares horizontally and one
square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally
away from it. The complete move therefore looks like the letter L. Check
out the image below to see all valid moves for a knight piece that is
placed on one of the central squares.

For cell = "a1", the output should be
chessKnight(cell) = 2.

For cell = "c2", the output should be
chessKnight(cell) = 6.

    // My first super dirty solution
    function chessKnight(cell) {
        let moves = 0;
        const columns = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
        const rows = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
        const colNum = columns.indexOf(cell[0])
        const rowNum = rows.indexOf(Number(cell[1])) + 1
        const possibleSpots = [
          columns[(colNum + 1)] + (rowNum + 2),
          columns[(colNum + 2)] + (rowNum + 1),
          columns[(colNum - 1)] + (rowNum + 2),
          columns[(colNum - 2)] + (rowNum + 1),
          columns[(colNum + 1)] + (rowNum - 2),
          columns[(colNum + 2)] + (rowNum - 1),
          columns[(colNum - 1)] + (rowNum - 2),
          columns[(colNum - 2)] + (rowNum - 1),

        ].filter(x => typeof x === 'string')

        for (let i = 0; i < possibleSpots.length; i++) {
          let a = possibleSpots[i][0]
          let b = Number(possibleSpots[i].slice(1))
          console.log(typeof possibleSpots[i])
          if (columns.includes(a) && rows.includes(b)) {
            moves++
          }
        }

        console.log(possibleSpots)

        return moves
      }

/* Top solution:
Created an array holding a matrix resembling a chessboarding, which
each tile being represented by the amount of possible moves a knight has
when on it.
stores the charcode of cell[0] but offset by 97.
'a' has a charcode of 97.  So this is to convert each letter into it's
corresponding value of the alphabet, starting at 1.
a=1, b=2...z=26

returns:
chessboard at cell[1] offset by -1 because the rows go from 1-8 on a chessboard,
but index is 0-7.
Once in the correct row, it returns that row at index of x, which is
the numerical representation of a letter.  So like 'd' would be index 3.

so if cell = 'd4'
then chessboard[4-1][3] navigates to the 4th row, and 4th element (3rd index tho)
and we can see it has 8 possible moves.

function chessKnight(cell) {
    const chessBoard = [
        [2,3,4,4,4,4,3,2],
        [3,4,6,6,6,6,4,3],
        [4,6,8,8,8,8,6,4],
        [4,6,8,8,8,8,6,4],
        [4,6,8,8,8,8,6,4],
        [4,6,8,8,8,8,6,4],
        [3,4,6,6,6,6,4,3],
        [2,3,4,4,4,4,3,2],
    ]

    const x = cell[0].charCodeAt() - 97;
    console.log(x)
    return chessBoard[cell[1] - 1][x]
}
*/

/* 2nd place solution.  hard to read.
basically finds the index of cell[0] in a string of 'abcdefgh'
i = cell[1] but i have no clue why he multiplies by 1.  Only thing I can think of
is some type of type conversion

He makes an array of all the possible spaces from the 'cell' a knight can move
then he filters it in which after adding the offsets to the starting position, it still
falls within range of col 1-8 and rows 1-8.
returns the length of that array.

function chessKnight(cell) {
    let j = 'abcdefgh'.indexOf(cell[0])+1,
    i = cell[1] * 1;
    return [[2,1],[2,-1],[1,2],[1,-2],[-2,1],[-2,-1],[-1,2],[-1,-2]].filter(el =>
        i + el[0] > 0 && i + el[0] <= 8 &&
            j + el[1] > 0 && j + el[1] <= 8
    ).length;
}
