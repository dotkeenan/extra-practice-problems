/* description
You have k apple boxes full of apples. Each square box of size m contains m Ã— m apples. You just noticed two interesting properties about the boxes:

The smallest box is size 1, the next one is size 2,..., all the way up to size k.
Boxes that have an odd size contain only yellow apples. Boxes that have an even size contain only red apples.
Your task is to calculate the difference between the number of red apples and the number of yellow apples.

Example

For k = 5, the output should be
appleBoxes(k) = -15.

There are 1 + 3 * 3 + 5 * 5 = 35 yellow apples and 2 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 20 red apples, making the answer 20 - 35 = -15.
*/
    function appleBoxes(k) {
        let res = 0;

        while (k > 0) {
          if (k % 2 === 0) {
            res += k ** 2;
          } else {
            res -= k ** 2;
          }
          k--
        }
        return res;
      }
/*
add when even
subtract when odd

create a storage named 'res' initialized at 0, which will store the cumulative total of
red apples - yellow apples

create a loop that runs k times.
on each iteration, if k is odd, then subtract k * k from res
if k is even, add k * k to res.
decrement k

return res
*/

/* top solution
k * (k+1) / 2 is a known algorithm to get the sum of each number
counting up to k. (i.e if k = 5, 1+2+3+4+5 = 15.)

I guess somehow when dealing with k ** 2,
it's like the equivalent of adding the sum of numbers leading up to k???

function appleBoxes(k) {
    return k * (k + 1) / (k % 2 ? -2 : 2);
}
