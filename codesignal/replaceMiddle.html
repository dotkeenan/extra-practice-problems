/* description
We define the middle of the array arr as follows:

if arr contains an odd number of elements, its middle is the element whose index number is the same when counting from the beginning of the array and from its end;
if arr contains an even number of elements, its middle is the sum of the two elements whose index numbers when counting from the beginning and from the end of the array differ by one.
Given array arr, your task is to find its middle, and, if it consists of two elements, replace those elements with the value of middle. Return the resulting array as the answer.

Example

For arr = [7, 2, 2, 5, 10, 7], the output should be
replaceMiddle(arr) = [7, 2, 7, 10, 7].

The middle consists of two elements, 2 and 5. These two elements should be replaced with their sum, i.e. 7.

For arr = [-5, -5, 10], the output should be
replaceMiddle(arr) = [-5, -5, 10].

The middle is defined as a single element -5, so the initial array with no changes should be returned.

    function replaceMiddle(arr) {
        if (arr.length % 2 === 1) return arr;
        const midLower = Math.floor((arr.length - 1) / 2);
        const midUpper = Math.ceil((arr.length - 1) / 2);
        const sum = arr[midLower] + arr[midUpper]
        arr.splice(midLower, 2, sum);
        return arr;
      }

/* pseudocode
if the array length is odd, just return arr
create a storage named midLower and set it equal to the length of the array minus 1, divided by 2, and rounded down
create a storage named midUpper and set it equal to the length of the array minus 1, divided by 2, and rounded up.
the minus 1 is to offset for 0 indexing.

remove 2 array elements, starting at midLower index
  */

/* top solution:
store arr.length - 1 in 'l'
if arr.length-1 (0 index offset), then re-assign and add
the rounded down middle value to the rounded up middle value (when array length is even, there are two middle values)
then splice out the upper middle value from the array.

function replaceMiddle(arr) {
    l = arr.length - 1;
    if (l%2) {
        arr[Math.floor(l/2)] += arr[Math.ceil(l/2)];
        arr.splice(Math.ceil(l/2),1);
    }
    return arr;
}
