/* description
You're given three integers, a, b and c. It is guaranteed that two of these integers are equal to each other. What is the value of the third integer?

Example

For a = 2, b = 7, and c = 2, the output should be
extraNumber(a, b, c) = 7.

The two equal numbers are a and c. The third number (b) equals 7, which is the answer.

        const nums = [a, b, c]
        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
          if (nums.filter(x => x === nums[i]).length === 1) {
            return nums[i]
          }
