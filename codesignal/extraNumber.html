/* description
You're given three integers, a, b and c. It is guaranteed that two of these integers are equal to each other. What is the value of the third integer?

Example

For a = 2, b = 7, and c = 2, the output should be
extraNumber(a, b, c) = 7.

The two equal numbers are a and c. The third number (b) equals 7, which is the answer.
*/
    function extraNumber(a, b, c) {
        const nums = [a, b, c]
        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
          if (nums.filter(x => x === nums[i]).length === 1) {
            return nums[i]
          }
        }
      }

/* top solution:
some weird genius bitwise XOR solution
ex: extraNumber(3, 5, 3)
bitwise conversions:
3 === ...011
5 === ...101
3 === ...011

(3^5) === ...110 or 6
so then 6^3 === 101 or 5.

5 is the non repeating number.

I have absolutely no idea how this works.  Will look up later.

function extraNumber(a, b, c) {
    return (a^b)^c
}
