After becoming famous, the CodeBots decided to move into a new building together. Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free, but there's a rumour that all the free rooms are haunted! Since the CodeBots are quite superstitious, they refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, or any of the rooms below any of the free rooms.

Given matrix, a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the cost of the room, your task is to return the total sum of all rooms that are suitable for the CodeBots (ie: add up all the values that don't appear below a 0).

Example

For

matrix = [[0, 1, 1, 2],
          [0, 5, 0, 0],
          [2, 0, 3, 3]]
the output should be
matrixElementsSum(matrix) = 9.


Notes:
      iterate over 'matrix'.
      iterate over each subarray

      If there is a non-zero value in the index position that includes the indexes
      stored in the haunted array, ignore it and do not add it to the cost variable.

      check if a value is 0 or not
      if not, add that number to the cost variable
      if it is zero, get the index position of that 0 and store it in a array named haunted

Clear solution:  iterates the arrays as columns (in a sense) instead of rows
function matrixElementsSum(matrix) {
    var total = 0;

    // Navigate each column of rooms
    // i = current column, j = current floor in column
    for (var i = 0; i < matrix[0].length; i++) {

        for (var j = 0; j < matrix.length; j++) {
            if (matrix[j][i] === 0) {
                // This room is haunted, so we don't care about the rooms below it.
                // Continue to the next column of rooms
                break;
            }
            total += matrix[j][i];
        }

    }

    return total;
}
