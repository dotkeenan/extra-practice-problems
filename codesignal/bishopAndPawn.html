  /*
  Given the positions of a white bishop and a black pawn on the standard chess board, determine whether the bishop can capture the pawn in one move.

The bishop has no restrictions in distance for each move, but is limited to diagonal movement. Check out the example below to see how it can move:

Example
https://codesignal.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/bishopAndPawn/img/ex1.jpg?_tm=1581997207686For bishop = "a1" and pawn = "c3", the output should be
bishopAndPawn(bishop, pawn) = true.


https://codesignal.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/bishopAndPawn/img/ex2.jpg?_tm=1581997207976For bishop = "h1" and pawn = "h3", the output should be
bishopAndPawn(bishop, pawn) = false.

        const rowDis = Math.abs(Number(bishop[1] - pawn[1]))
        return colDis === rowDis;
      }
      // Other solution that just uses indexes of an array of letters to find
      // distance between two letter columns.  Less verbose but a little more
      // confusing with cols.indexOf()
      function bishopAndPawn(bishop, pawn) {
        const cols = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h'];
        // find distance between bishop and pawn columns
        const colDis = Math.abs(cols.indexOf(bishop[0]) - cols.indexOf(pawn[0]))
        const rowDis = Math.abs(Number(bishop[1] - pawn[1]))

      }
/* pseudo code and brainstorm
a bishop can attack a pawn if:
the pawn is not on the same letter column or number row, as bishop

the spaces a bishop can attack a pawn, progresses/regresses linearly
if a pawn is 2 letter columns away, it must be 2 number rows higher or lower than it.

find distance between letters (i.e. c is 2 away from a) (absolute value)
find distance between row numbers (absolute value)
if the degree of separation in pawn and bishops letters matches the degree of separation in number row, then it is true.
aka, if bishop is on d4 and pawn is a, distance between a and d = 3.
pawn MUST be either 4+3 or 4-3, aka a7 or a1.

make an object with letter to number associations??
make an array filled with letters?

{a:1, b:2 ... h:8}

/* top solution:
Similar to mine.  Just uses charCodeAt() to get value of a letter.

function bishopAndPawn(bishop, pawn) {
  return Math.abs(bishop[0].charCodeAt()-pawn[0].charCodeAt())===Math.abs(bishop[1]-pawn[1])
}
