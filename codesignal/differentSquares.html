/*  description
Given a rectangular matrix containing only digits, calculate the number of different 2 × 2 squares in it.

Example

For

matrix = [[1, 2, 1],
          [2, 2, 2],
          [2, 2, 2],
          [1, 2, 3],
          [2, 2, 1]]
the output should be
differentSquares(matrix) = 6.

Here are all 6 different 2 × 2 squares:

1 2
2 2
2 1
2 2
2 2
2 2
2 2
1 2
2 2
2 3
2 3
2 1
*/
    function differentSquares(matrix) {
        const unique = []

        for (let i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++) {
          let tempString = '';
          for (let j = 1; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
            tempString = matrix[i - 1][j - 1].toString() + matrix[i - 1][j].toString() + matrix[i][j - 1].toString() + matrix[i][j].toString()
            if (!unique.includes(tempString)) { unique.push(tempString) }
          }
        }
        return unique.length
      }
/* pseudo code
probably deal with a nested loop

iterate over the matrix,
then iterate over the sub array

initialize both arrays at 1, and use i-1 to get the value before it
instead of starting at 0 and checking i + 1 to avoid issues regarding last array index.

create an empty array to store all the unique 2x2 squares, named 'unique'

//this is purely for visualization, not how I will actually represent the squares
# = the level of the matrix
letter = semblence of index position within the level's sub array

just push in a string version of the square, like '1a1b2a2b'

Only push a unique square combination into 'unique' if it is not already included in 'unique'.
Need to compare the equality of the strings.

return length of 'unique'.

/* top solution
Does something very similar to me
uses Set() in order to make sure all contents in the array are unique.
does the same nested loops but instead initializes at 0, and stops at length - 1.
Also the way he/she accesses the array elements and adds them, is very similar

The clever thing he/she did was for each successive part of the 2x2 square,
was to multiply it by an increases magnitude of 10 (10, 100, 1000, etc)

So when they are all added up together, it mimics having added them as a string
like if the 2x2 square was comprised of 1,2,3,4 (but reversed)
it would come out to be 1 + 20 + 300 + 4000, which = 4321

I guess reversing the order is just a matter of preference. (starting from
the front and compiling the square in order like 1234, instead of 4321)

uses the .add() method of a Set that only adds unique things to the array-like object.
it ignores duplicates.

then he'she returns the .size property of set, which is like .length

function differentSquares(a) {
    var s = new Set;
    for( var i=0; i<a.length-1; i++ ) {
        for( var j=0; j<a[0].length-1; j++ ) {
            var hash = a[i][j] + 10*a[i][j+1] + 100*a[i+1][j] + 1000*a[i+1][j+1];
            s.add( hash );
        }
    }

    return s.size;
}
