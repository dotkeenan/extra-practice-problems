/* pseudocode
      create an array filled with the alphabet called alphaArr
      iterate over inputString and use string.prototype.replace() with value and index parameters
      find the indexOf the current interation within alphaArr.
      replace the current iteration with alphaArr.indexOf(i + 1)
      issue when there is a Z since index of z + 1 would be undefined.
      Use modulous of iteration + 1 with array.length to make it 'wrap' back around to beginning of array.

/*
Given a string, your task is to replace each of its characters by the
next one in the English alphabet; i.e. replace a with b, replace b with c,
etc (z would be replaced by a).

Example

For inputString = "crazy", the output should be alphabeticShift(inputString) = "dsbaz".

 /*
 top solution
Uses just a regular string for the alphabet since strings are iterable.
-Smart caveat, just adds an 'a' after 'z' for the case when 'z' shows up, since
z + 1 will just become 'a'.  indexOf(a) will find the first 'a' and stop there (never finds 2nd 'a' after 'z')
Uses replace() and regex of ./g to match 'any character except linebreak'
(I feel it should just be a-z and not 'any character')
It replaces 'any character' with the result of an arrow function:
the 'x' index (of 'c'),  + 1.
-in my solution, x would be 'char', and 'char' is the current iteration of the
map() method that I used.
-From the replace() documentation, the 2nd argument (replacement) can be a function
that has a lot of built in arguments.  One of which is the matched substring (from the first argument)


 function alphabeticShift(s) {
  var c="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza"
  return s.replace(/./g,x=>c[c.indexOf(x)+1])
}
