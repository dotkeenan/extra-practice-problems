/* description
We define the middle of the array arr as follows:

if arr contains an odd number of elements, its middle is the element whose index number is the same when counting from the beginning of the array and from its end;
if arr contains an even number of elements, its middle is the sum of the two elements whose index numbers when counting from the beginning and from the end of the array differ by one.
An array is called smooth if its first and its last elements are equal to one another and to the middle. Given an array arr, determine if it is smooth or not.

Example

For arr = [7, 2, 2, 5, 10, 7], the output should be
isSmooth(arr) = true.

The first and the last elements of arr are equal to 7, and its middle also equals 2 + 5 = 7. Thus, the array is smooth and the output is true.

For arr = [-5, -5, 10], the output should be
isSmooth(arr) = false.

The first and middle elements are equal to -5, but the last element equals 10. Thus, arr is not smooth and the output is false.
*/
    function isSmooth(arr) {
        if (arr[0] !== arr[arr.length - 1]) return false;
        if (arr.length % 2 === 0) {
          let upper = Math.ceil((arr.length - 1) / 2)
          let lower = Math.floor((arr.length - 1) / 2)
          if (arr[upper] + arr[lower] === arr[0]) return true;
        }
        if (arr.length % 2 === 1) {
          let middle = Math.ceil((arr.length - 1) / 2)
          console.log(arr[middle])
          if (arr[middle] === arr[0]) return true
        }
        return false;
      }
/* pseudocode
quick check to see if first and last array elements are the same.  If not, return false.

if array length is even,
take the array length - 1, and divide it by 2,
store the rounded up version and rounded down version into variables named upper and lower.
add the array element at position 'upper' and array element at position 'lower'
if the result is the same as the first/last element, return true.

if the array length is odd,
take the array length, divide it by 2 - 1, and round up.
if the result is the same as the first/last array element, return true

return false.
