/* description
When a candle finishes burning it leaves a leftover. makeNew leftovers can be combined to make a new candle, which, when burning down, will in turn leave another leftover.

You have candlesNumber candles in your possession. What's the total number of candles you can burn, assuming that you create new candles as soon as you have enough leftovers?

Example

For candlesNumber = 5 and makeNew = 2, the output should be
candles(candlesNumber, makeNew) = 9.

Here is what you can do to burn 9 candles:

burn 5 candles, obtain 5 leftovers;
create 2 more candles, using 4 leftovers (1 leftover remains);
burn 2 candles, end up with 3 leftovers;
create another candle using 2 leftovers (1 leftover remains);
burn the created candle, which gives another leftover (2 leftovers in total);
create a candle from the remaining leftovers;
burn the last candle.
Thus, you can burn 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9 candles, which is the answer.

    function candles(candlesNumber, makeNew) {
        let leftovers = candlesNumber;
        let candles = candlesNumber;

        while (leftovers >= makeNew) {
          let newCandles = Math.floor(leftovers / makeNew)
          candles += newCandles
          leftovers = newCandles + (leftovers % makeNew)
        }
        return candles;
      }

      /* pseudocode

      create storage for leftovers initialized as candlesNumber.
      create storage for candles initialized as candlesNumber

      run a loop that continues as long as there are enough leftovers to make a new candle.
      divide leftovers by makeNew, round that result down, and assign to a storage named newCandles
      add and assign newCandles to candles
      assign leftovers the result newCandles added to remainder of newCandles divided by makeNew

      return candles

/*  top solution:
Not quite sure how this works or if its just some known mathematical
algorithm.
if candles = 5 and makeNew = 2,
return 5 + (4/1) = 9.  It's correct... but not sure the math behind it.


function candles(candles, makeNew) {
    return candles + Math.floor((candles - 1) / (makeNew - 1));
}
