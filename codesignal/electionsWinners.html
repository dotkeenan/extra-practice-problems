    /*
    Elections are in progress!

Given an array of the numbers of votes given to each of the candidates so far, and an integer k equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet, find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election.

The winner of the election must secure strictly more votes than any other candidate. If two or more candidates receive the same (maximum) number of votes, assume there is no winner at all.

Example

For votes = [2, 3, 5, 2] and k = 3, the output should be
electionsWinners(votes, k) = 2.

The first candidate got 2 votes. Even if all of the remaining 3 candidates vote for him, he will still have only 5 votes, i.e. the same number as the third candidate, so there will be no winner.
The second candidate can win if all the remaining candidates vote for him (3 + 3 = 6 > 5).
The third candidate can win even if none of the remaining candidates vote for him. For example, if each of the remaining voters cast their votes for each of his opponents, he will still be the winner (the votes array will thus be [3, 4, 5, 3]).
The last candidate can't win no matter what (for the same reason as the first candidate).
Thus, only 2 candidates can win (the second and the third), which is the answer.

    /* explanation of my code
    Find the max value in the array.
    filter all values that when added to 'k', are > max, OR
    when x === max.
    The length of that array is stored in 'r'.
    This array signifies all the possible winners.

    There is caveat for when k = 0 and there are multiple votes with the value of
    'max'

    the commented out conditional is a short one liner, but I wrote more
    readable 'if' statement below it.

    If K === 0, and if r === 1 (meaning there are no ties for the max),
    then return 1.
    if K === 0 but r !== 1 (there are ties), then return 0, meaning there
    are 0 clear winners.

    if K is truthy (k > 0) then return r, aka the amount of votes if added to k,
    that is greater than 'max'.

    function electionsWinners(votes, k) {
        var max = Math.max(...votes)
        var r = votes.filter(x => x + k > max || x === max).length
        // return k?r:r==1?1:0
        if (!k) {
          if (r === 1) {
            return 1;
          } else {
            return 0;
          }
        } else {
          return r
        }
      }

//         return 0;
