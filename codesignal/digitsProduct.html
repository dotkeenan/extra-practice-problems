/*
Given an integer product, find the smallest positive (i.e. greater than 0) integer the product of whose digits is equal to product. If there is no such integer, return -1 instead.

Example

For product = 12, the output should be
digitsProduct(product) = 26;
For product = 19, the output should be
digitsProduct(product) = -1.
For product = 243, the output should be digitsProduct(product) = 399

  /*  explanation of code, and recursion
  Uses a for loop that iterates from 9 to 2.
  The idea behind it is to keep finding the highest digit that is a factor of 'product'
  and to put them at the end of the final number, because we want the SMALLEST integer, who's digits multiply
  to become 'product'

  ex:  product = 243
  243 % 9 === 0
  nextDigit = 243/9 // 27
  recursively run digitsProduct(27);

  first recursive run:
  27 % 9 === 0
  nextDigit = 27/9 = 3
  recursively run digitsProduct(3)

  second recursive run:
  gets triggered: else if (product < 10) return product
  steps out of 2nd recursive run and continues to if(nextDigit === -1) return -1;

  smallPos = 0 * 10 + 3 // 3
  product = 9

  if(9 === 27) return -1;
  break;

  Starts next iteration of while loop but product is not > 9 // 9 !> 9

  so it just returns the last line, which is 3 * 10 + product // 39

  So we finished all recursion and are back out in the first run of the while loop(?)

  at this point, nextDigit: 39, i: 9, orig: 243, product: 243, smallPos: 0
  and we are at the line right after nextDigit = digitsProduct(nextDigit)

  smallPos = 39, product = 9
  break

  start next while loop iteration, but 9 !> 9, so we go down to the return, which is
  39 * 10 + 9 // 399
  3 * 9 * 9 = 243

/* solutions
Top solution:
function digitsProduct(product) {
    if (product == 0) return 10;
    if (product == 1) return 1;
    var divisor = 10,
        power = 1,
        result = 0;
    while (product > 1) {
        if (--divisor == 1) return -1;
        while (product % divisor == 0) {
            product /= divisor;
            result += divisor * power;
            power *= 10;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
starts with same edge case catches
declares divisor, power and result

while loop that runs as long as product > 1
if divisor is decremented and is === 1, then return -1
// not sure the logic behind this
nested while loop which runs as long as product % divisor === 0

// power is being used to create a number that represents individual digits.
similar to what I've been seeing lately, where you do this instead of
turning it into a string, concatenating, then turning back into number.
Instead you keep adding numbers that have a higher power of 10, so like if you
wanna make 321, you do 300 + 20 + 1.


Run through:
product = 243
243 > 1 // continue next line
9 !== 1 // skip to next line
243 % 9 === 0 // true, continue to next line

1st pass of outter loop, 1st pass nested loop
product = 243 / 9 // 27
result = 0 + 9 * 1 // 9
power = 1 * 10

1st pass of outter while loop, 2nd pass of nested while loop:
27 % 9 === 0 // true continue to next line
product = 27 / 9 === 3
result = 9 + 9 * 10 === 99
power = 10 * 10 === 100

1st pass outter loop, 3rd pass of nested while loop,
3 % 9 !== 0 // false, break out and return to outter while loop

Next few passes, the 2nd while loop's never gets satisfied, until divisor
decrements enough to become 3

then the 2nd while loop finally works, since 3 % 3 === 0 // next line
product = 1 / 3 // 1 for some reason and not .333 ?
result = 99 + 3 * 100 === 399

next pass of 2nd while loop doesnt pass since 1 % 3 !== 0
so it breaks out to the 1st while loop, and that fails too since 1 !> 1

So then we just return result which is 399



crappy version that kinda just runs an unnecessary amount of times, and uses
a hard coded loop count that just happens to pass the tests. (10000)
function digitsProduct(product) {
    for(let i = 1; i < 10000; i++) {
        if([...i.toString()].reduce((a,b) => a * b, 1) === product){
            console.log([...i.toString()])
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

  /*  brain storm
  Find a way to get all factors of 'product'

  create a loop that iterates from 1 to 'product'
  divide 'product' by 'i', and if it divides without remainder,
  store the pair of (i, and the result of 'product'/i)
  -store as a concatenated string in an array

  once the array is filled with all the factor pairs,
  return the lowest value in the array
  (may have to convert all the array contents to numbers)

  issues:
  Approached and understood the problem wrong.  Each singular digit in the number is used in the product
  so for like 360, I was trying to submit something like 3 * 120, and would return 3120.
  but it's expecting 3 * 1 * 2 * 0.
  i need to find the lowest number in which the product of all individual digits is === product
