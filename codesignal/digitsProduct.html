/*
Given an integer product, find the smallest positive (i.e. greater than 0) integer the product of whose digits is equal to product. If there is no such integer, return -1 instead.

Example

For product = 12, the output should be
digitsProduct(product) = 26;
For product = 19, the output should be
digitsProduct(product) = -1.
For product = 243, the output should be digitsProduct(product) = 399

  /*  explanation of code, and recursion
  Uses a for loop that iterates from 9 to 2.
  The idea behind it is to keep finding the highest digit that is a factor of 'product'
  and to put them at the end of the final number, because we want the SMALLEST integer, who's digits multiply
  to become 'product'

  ex:  product = 243
  243 % 9 === 0
  nextDigit = 243/9 // 27
  recursively run digitsProduct(27);

  first recursive run:
  27 % 9 === 0
  nextDigit = 27/9 = 3
  recursively run digitsProduct(3)

  second recursive run:
  gets triggered: else if (product < 10) return product
  steps out of 2nd recursive run and continues to if(nextDigit === -1) return -1;

  smallPos = 0 * 10 + 3 // 3
  product = 9

  if(9 === 27) return -1;
  break;

  Starts next iteration of while loop but product is not > 9 // 9 !> 9

  so it just returns the last line, which is 3 * 10 + product // 39

  So we finished all recursion and are back out in the first run of the while loop(?)

  at this point, nextDigit: 39, i: 9, orig: 243, product: 243, smallPos: 0
  and we are at the line right after nextDigit = digitsProduct(nextDigit)

  smallPos = 39, product = 9
  break

  start next while loop iteration, but 9 !> 9, so we go down to the return, which is
  39 * 10 + 9 // 399
  3 * 9 * 9 = 243

/* solutions



crappy version that kinda just runs an unnecessary amount of times, and uses
a hard coded loop count that just happens to pass the tests. (10000)
function digitsProduct(product) {
    for(let i = 1; i < 10000; i++) {
        if([...i.toString()].reduce((a,b) => a * b, 1) === product){
            console.log([...i.toString()])
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

  /*  brain storm
  Find a way to get all factors of 'product'

  create a loop that iterates from 1 to 'product'
  divide 'product' by 'i', and if it divides without remainder,
  store the pair of (i, and the result of 'product'/i)
  -store as a concatenated string in an array

  once the array is filled with all the factor pairs,
  return the lowest value in the array
  (may have to convert all the array contents to numbers)

  issues:
  Approached and understood the problem wrong.  Each singular digit in the number is used in the product
  so for like 360, I was trying to submit something like 3 * 120, and would return 3120.
  but it's expecting 3 * 1 * 2 * 0.
  i need to find the lowest number in which the product of all individual digits is === product
