/*
      Sort by height:
      Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall!

      Example

      For a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180], the output should be
      sortByHeight(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190].

      pseudo code:
      find index of all trees and store the value of the index's into an array named 'trees'
      extract non tree values and put into an array named 'heights'
      sort the array

      iterate over 'trees' and splice '-1' into the 'heights' array at the appropriate indexes.
