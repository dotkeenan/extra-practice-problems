/* description
You are given two numbers a and b where 0 ≤ a ≤ b. Imagine you construct an array of all the integers from a to b inclusive. You need to count the number of 1s in the binary representations of all the numbers in the array.

Example

For a = 2 and b = 7, the output should be
rangeBitCount(a, b) = 11.

Given a = 2 and b = 7 the array is: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Converting the numbers to binary, we get [10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111], which contains 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11 1s.
 */
    function rangeBitCount(a, b) {
        const arr = [];
        for (let i = a; i <= b; i++) {
          arr.push(i)
        }
        const bitArr = arr.map(x => x.toString(2))
        return bitArr.join('').replaceAll('0', '').length
      }
/* notes
need to create an counting array that starts at 'a' and ends with 'b'
use a for loop and push values of i into the empty array, named 'arr'.

need to convert each array element into it's binary representation.
map over the properly filled array and use toString(2) to turn them into string
representations of their binary form.

need to count how many 1's exist in the array.
join the array into one long string.

Use replaceAll() to replace all 0's with empty string '', and return the length of the
result of the expression.
 */

/* top solution:
create an empty string
use a while loop in order to iterate over values between and including 'a' and 'b',
and adding each one's binary form to the empty string.

return the length - 1 of the string split() at '1'.



function rangeBitCount(a, b) {
    var packed = "";
    while(a <= b){
        packed += a.toString(2);
        a++;
    }
    return packed.split('1').length-1;
}
