Once Mary heard a famous song, and a line from it stuck in her head. That line was "Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?". Mary believes that a person is loved if and only if he/she is both young and beautiful, but this is quite a depressing thought, so she wants to put her belief to the test.

Knowing whether a person is young, beautiful and loved, find out if they contradict Mary's belief.

A person contradicts Mary's belief if one of the following statements is true:

they are young and beautiful but not loved;
they are loved but not young or not beautiful.
Example

For young = true, beautiful = true, and loved = true, the output should be
willYou(young, beautiful, loved) = false.

Young and beautiful people are loved according to Mary's belief.

For young = true, beautiful = false, and loved = true, the output should be
willYou(young, beautiful, loved) = true.

Mary doesn't believe that not beautiful people can be loved.
 */
    function willYou(young, beautiful, loved) {
        const yAndB = young && beautiful ? true : false;
        return !(yAndB === loved)
      }
/*
after reviewing it, its completely unnecessary to have that ternary,
since young && beautiful would already evaluate to true or false.

also instead of using bang operator, i could just do yAndB !== loved, but
logically it doesn't make as much sense.
 */
/*
      tricky wording, but basically return false if it aligns with Mary's beliefs
      return true if it contradicts Mary's beliefs.

      Mary's beliefs: // return false in these cases
      if you are young and beautiful, you are loved
      if you are NOT young and NOT beautiful, you are NOT loved.

      create a variable named yAndB that stores whether or not both young and beautiful are truthy, using ternary.

      return the OPPOSITE of the result of the comparison between yAndB and loved. (due to the weird ass wording).
       */
/* top solution:


function willYou(young, beautiful, loved) {
    return (young && beautiful) != loved;
}
