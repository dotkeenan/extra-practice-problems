/*
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. There are two versions of the Internet protocol, and thus two versions of addresses. One of them is the IPv4 address.

Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.

Example

For inputString = "172.16.254.1", the output should be
isIPv4Address(inputString) = true;

For inputString = "172.316.254.1", the output should be
isIPv4Address(inputString) = false.

316 is not in range [0, 255].

For inputString = ".254.255.0", the output should be
isIPv4Address(inputString) = false.

There is no first number.


top solution:
Top solution is basically a slimmed down version of mine.  So I guess i'm not that far off.
return true IF:
-the length of 'r' (aka s.split('.')) is 4.
-every element in 'r' does NOT equal '' empty string
-every element in 'r' is a number (isNaN attempts to type coerce first.
Thats why it works even tho it is running isNaN() on a string)
-each number is between the accepted range of 0 - 255.

function isIPv4Address(s) {
  var  r=s.split(".")
  return r.length === 4 && r.every(x => x != "" && !isNaN(x) && x >= 0 && x < 256)
}
