/* description
A little boy is studying arithmetic. He has just learned how to add two integers, written one below another, column by column. But he always forgets about the important part - carrying.

Given two integers, your task is to find the result which the little boy will get.

Note: The boy had learned from this site, so feel free to check it out too if you are not familiar with column addition.

Example

For param1 = 456 and param2 = 1734, the output should be
additionWithoutCarrying(param1, param2) = 1180.

   456
  1734
+ ____
  1180
The boy performs the following operations from right to left:

6 + 4 = 10 but he forgets about carrying the 1 and just writes down the 0 in the last column
5 + 3 = 8
4 + 7 = 11 but he forgets about the leading 1 and just writes down 1 under 4 and 7.
There is no digit in the first number corresponding to the leading digit of the second one, so the boy imagines that 0 is written before 456. Thus, he gets 0 + 1 = 1.
*/
    function additionWithoutCarrying(param1, param2) {
        const strParam1 = param1.toString(), strParam2 = param2.toString()
        let shortestParam = strParam1.length > strParam2.length ? strParam2 : strParam1
        let longestParam = strParam1.length > strParam2.length ? strParam1 : strParam2
        let res = '';
        /* if they are the same length, just perform the operation */
        if (strParam1.length === strParam2.length) {
          for (let i = 0; i < strParam1.length; i++) {
            res += ((Number(strParam1[i]) + Number(strParam2[i])) % 10)
          }
        } else {
          /* add leading zeroes to the shorter param and add each digit */
          let zeros = '0'.repeat(longestParam.length)
          shortestParam = zeros.slice(shortestParam.length) + shortestParam
          for (let i = 0; i < longestParam.length; i++) {
            let remainder = ((Number(longestParam[i]) + Number(shortestParam[i])) % 10)
            console.log(remainder)
            res += remainder
          }
        }
        return Number(res);
      }
  /*
  create storages named strParam1 and strParam2, and assign the string versions of param1 and param2 to them
  create storage named shortestParam to store the value shortest length parameter
  create storage named longestParam to store the longest length paramater
  create a storage named res to store the string representation of the addition without carrying

  create a conditional, if param1 and param2 are equal in length, then loop over the length of the params
  and take the remainder after adding the current digits of param1 and param2 together.
  add that result to 'res'

  if the conditional is false,
  Add leading zeros to the shortestParam and store the result in a storage named 'zeros'
  create a loop running the length of the longestParam
  create a storage named 'remainder' and assign it the remainder after adding the numeric version of the current digits of param1 and param2 without carrying.
  add and assign 'remainder' to 'res'

  return the Number version of 'res'
   */

/* top solution:
set result to 0
set num to 1 (represents the power of 10, or rather a way to add digits
in a string like, concatenating fashion)
while loop that runs as long as param1 + param 2 > 0.
each iteration multiplies num by 10 (adding a tens place).
addition of para1 and param2 and take the remainder of it when divided by 'num'

the whole next subtraction assignment is big brain
it keeps subtracting the last digits value from the param.
so if param1 was 1234, it would go:
1230, 1200, 1000, 0.

By doing all of this, with the whole power of 10 thing as well,
this person avoided having to conver to strings and back to numbers like I did.


function additionWithoutCarrying(param1, param2) {
    var result = 0,
        num = 1;
    while (param1 + param2 > 0) {
        num *= 10;
        result += (param1 + param2) % num;
        param1 -= param1 % num;
        param2 -= param2 % num;
    }
    return result;
}
